# Introduction
This folder contains the code for the Word2Vec model using the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW with and without negative sampling) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) methods. The code is written in Python and uses the PyTorch library for the CBOW model. The code for the SVD model is written from scratch. The code is written in a modular way and is easy to understand. The code is written in a way that it can be easily extended to other models and datasets.

## Implemented Models
1. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) with negative sampling
2. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) without negative sampling
3. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Datasets
The code is tested on the following datasets:
1. `test.json` file.

- Google Colab is used for the implementation of the code.
