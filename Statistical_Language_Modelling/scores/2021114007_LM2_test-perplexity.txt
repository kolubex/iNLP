bennet <PUN> s visit <PUN> and sat about ten minutes with him in his library <PUN>    PP Score = 3.884
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire <PUN> and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another <PUN> and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be <PUN>    PP Score = 2.810

the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man <PUN> the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.759
bingley <PUN> and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening <PUN> till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity <PUN> for he was discovered to be proud <PUN> to be above his company <PUN> and above being pleased <PUN> and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding <PUN> disagreeable countenance <PUN> and being unworthy to be compared with his friend <PUN>    PP Score = 2.471
amongst the most violent against him was mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.473
darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.187
<PUN> come <PUN> darcy <PUN> <PUN> said he <PUN> <PUN> i must have you dance <PUN>    PP Score = 7.041
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner <PUN>    PP Score = 3.367
<PUN> <PUN> i certainly shall not <PUN>    PP Score = 6.733
your sisters are engaged <PUN> and there is not another woman in the room <PUN> whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with <PUN>    PP Score = 3.893
<PUN> <PUN> i would not be so fastidious as you are <PUN> <PUN> cried bingley <PUN> <PUN> for a kingdom <PUN>    PP Score = 5.502
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld <PUN>    PP Score = 4.429
but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you <PUN> who is very pretty <PUN> and i dare say <PUN> very agreeable <PUN>    PP Score = 3.903
<PUN> and turning round <PUN> he looked for a moment at elizabeth <PUN> till catching her eye <PUN> he withdrew his own and coldly said <PUN> <PUN> she is tolerable <PUN> but not handsome enough to tempt <PUN> me <PUN> <PUN> and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men <PUN>    PP Score = 3.059

elizabeth felt jane <PUN> s pleasure <PUN>    PP Score = 11.007
bennet still up <PUN>    PP Score = 22.437
bingley thought her quite beautiful <PUN> and danced with her twice <PUN>    PP Score = 3.107
so <PUN> he enquired who she was <PUN> and got introduced <PUN> and asked her for the two next <PUN>    PP Score = 3.638
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance <PUN>    PP Score = 8.126
i dare say the lace upon mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 10.523
i quite detest the man <PUN>    PP Score = 8.121
when jane and elizabeth were alone <PUN> the former <PUN> who had been cautious in her praise of mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.660
<PUN> he is just what a young man ought to be <PUN> <PUN> said she <PUN> <PUN> sensible <PUN> good humoured <PUN> lively <PUN> and i never saw such happy manners <PUN>    PP Score = 3.865
compliments always take <PUN> you <PUN> by surprise <PUN> and <PUN> me <PUN> never <PUN>    PP Score = 6.484
what could be more natural than his asking you again <PUN>    PP Score = 4.386
you are a great deal too apt you know <PUN> to like people in general <PUN>    PP Score = 5.667
you never see a fault in any body <PUN>    PP Score = 4.766
<PUN> <PUN> certainly not <PUN> at first <PUN>    PP Score = 4.370
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them <PUN>    PP Score = 3.495
<PUN> elizabeth listened in silence <PUN> but was not convinced <PUN> their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general <PUN> and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister <PUN> and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself <PUN> she was very little disposed to approve them <PUN>    PP Score = 3.227
they were of a respectable family in the north of england <PUN> a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother <PUN> s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade <PUN>    PP Score = 2.648
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
bingley intended it likewise <PUN> and sometimes made choice of his county <PUN> but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor <PUN> it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper <PUN> whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield <PUN> and leave the next generation to purchase <PUN>    PP Score = 2.838
<PUN> <PUN> bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness <PUN> openness <PUN> ductility of his temper <PUN> though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own <PUN> and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied <PUN>    PP Score = 3.121
bingley was by no means deficient <PUN> but darcy was clever <PUN>    PP Score = 4.337
he was at the same time haughty <PUN> reserved <PUN> and fastidious <PUN> and his manners <PUN> though well bred <PUN> were not inviting <PUN>    PP Score = 3.006
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
hurst and her sister allowed it to be so <PUN> <PUN> but still they admired her and liked her <PUN> and pronounced her to be a sweet girl <PUN> and one whom they should not object to know more of <PUN>    PP Score = 3.787
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly <PUN>    PP Score = 4.219
for though elated by his rank <PUN> it did not render him supercilious <PUN> on the contrary <PUN> he was all attention to every body <PUN>    PP Score = 4.168
by nature inoffensive <PUN> friendly and obliging <PUN> his presentation at st <PUN>    PP Score = 3.592
<PUN> <PUN> perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.094
<PUN> <PUN> upon my word <PUN>    PP Score = 4.504
<PUN> <PUN> well <PUN> that was very decided indeed <PUN> <PUN> that does seem as if <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> but however <PUN> it may all come to nothing you know <PUN>    PP Score = 3.895
<PUN> <PUN> is not there a little mistake <PUN>    PP Score = 5.171
<PUN> <PUN> i do not believe a word of it <PUN> my dear <PUN>    PP Score = 4.267
<PUN> <PUN> another time <PUN> lizzy <PUN> <PUN> said her mother <PUN> <PUN> i would not dance with <PUN> him <PUN> <PUN> if i were you <PUN>    PP Score = 4.777
vanity and pride are different things <PUN> though the words are often used synonimously <PUN>    PP Score = 4.218
<PUN> <PUN> if i were as rich as mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.738
in nine cases out of ten <PUN> a woman had better shew <PUN> more <PUN> affection than she feels <PUN>    PP Score = 2.686
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention <PUN>    PP Score = 3.071
when she is secure of him <PUN> there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses <PUN>    PP Score = 3.800
<PUN> <PUN> your plan is a good one <PUN> <PUN> replied elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married <PUN> and if i were determined to get a rich husband <PUN> or any husband <PUN> i dare say i should adopt it <PUN>    PP Score = 2.920
she danced four dances with him at meryton <PUN> she saw him one morning at his own house <PUN> and has since dined in company with him four times <PUN>    PP Score = 2.990

bingley <PUN> s attentions to her sister <PUN> elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend <PUN>    PP Score = 3.397
darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty <PUN> he had looked at her without admiration at the ball <PUN> and when they next met <PUN> he looked at her only to criticise <PUN>    PP Score = 3.703
his doing so drew her notice <PUN>    PP Score = 5.536
it was at sir william lucas <PUN> s <PUN> where a large party were assembled <PUN>    PP Score = 4.544
mary had neither genius nor taste <PUN> and though vanity had given her application <PUN> it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner <PUN> which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached <PUN>    PP Score = 2.776
darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening <PUN> to the exclusion of all conversation <PUN> and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour <PUN> till sir william thus began <PUN>    PP Score = 2.676
<PUN> <PUN> you saw me dance at meryton <PUN> i believe <PUN> sir <PUN>    PP Score = 3.796
<PUN> <PUN> you have a house in town <PUN> i conclude <PUN>    PP Score = 5.345

<PUN> <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.076
darcy is all politeness <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth <PUN> smiling <PUN>    PP Score = 5.312
<PUN> elizabeth looked archly <PUN> and turned away <PUN>    PP Score = 3.815
<PUN> miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face <PUN> and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections <PUN>    PP Score = 2.820

<PUN> catherine was disconcerted <PUN> and made no answer <PUN> but lydia <PUN> with perfect indifference <PUN> continued to express her admiration of captain carter <PUN> and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day <PUN> as he was going the next morning to london <PUN>    PP Score = 3.294
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular <PUN> but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish <PUN>    PP Score = 3.732
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
bennet <PUN> s eyes sparkled with pleasure <PUN> and she was eagerly calling out <PUN> while her daughter read <PUN> <PUN> well <PUN> jane <PUN> who is it from <PUN>    PP Score = 3.676
what does he say <PUN>    PP Score = 11.423

<PUN> cried lydia <PUN>    PP Score = 16.159
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback <PUN> and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day <PUN>    PP Score = 3.501
they insist also on my seeing mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.786
she will be taken good care of <PUN>    PP Score = 5.633
<PUN> elizabeth <PUN> feeling really anxious <PUN> was determined to go to her <PUN> though the carriage was not to be had <PUN> and as she was no horse <PUN> woman <PUN> walking was her only alternative <PUN>    PP Score = 3.687
<PUN> how can you be so silly <PUN> <PUN> cried her mother <PUN> <PUN> as to think of such a thing <PUN> in all this dirt <PUN>    PP Score = 4.590
you will not be fit to be seen when you get there <PUN>    PP Score = 4.907
<PUN> <PUN> elizabeth accepted their company <PUN> and the three young ladies set off together <PUN>    PP Score = 4.199
hurst and miss bingley <PUN> and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.703
hurst nothing at all <PUN>    PP Score = 10.223
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion <PUN> and doubt as to the occasion <PUN> s justifying her coming so far alone <PUN>    PP Score = 2.931
miss bingley offered her the carriage <PUN> and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it <PUN> when jane testified such concern in parting with her <PUN> that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present <PUN>    PP Score = 2.821
at five o <PUN> clock the two ladies retired to dress <PUN> and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner <PUN>    PP Score = 2.773
she had very little notice from any but him <PUN>    PP Score = 3.960
hurst <PUN> by whom elizabeth sat <PUN> he was an indolent man <PUN> who lived only to eat <PUN> drink <PUN> and play at cards <PUN> who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout <PUN> had nothing to say to her <PUN>    PP Score = 2.649
when dinner was over <PUN> she returned directly to jane <PUN> and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room <PUN>    PP Score = 3.795
<PUN> <PUN> your picture may be very exact <PUN> louisa <PUN> <PUN> said bingley <PUN> <PUN> but this was all lost upon me <PUN>    PP Score = 3.624
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> you <PUN> observed it <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.909
<PUN> <PUN> to walk three miles <PUN> or four miles <PUN> or five miles <PUN> or whatever it is <PUN> above her ancles in dirt <PUN> and alone <PUN> quite alone <PUN>    PP Score = 2.456
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> a short pause followed this speech <PUN> and mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 5.503
hurst began again <PUN>    PP Score = 21.786
but with such a father and mother <PUN> and such low connections <PUN> i am afraid there is no chance of it <PUN>    PP Score = 4.142
on entering the drawing <PUN> room she found the whole party at loo <PUN> and was immediately invited to join them <PUN> but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it <PUN> and making her sister the excuse <PUN> said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book <PUN>    PP Score = 2.674
<PUN> <PUN> in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure <PUN> <PUN> said bingley <PUN> <PUN> and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well <PUN>    PP Score = 4.220
<PUN> elizabeth thanked him from her heart <PUN> and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying <PUN>    PP Score = 3.694
he immediately offered to fetch her others <PUN> all that his library afforded <PUN>    PP Score = 3.603
<PUN> <PUN> i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these <PUN>    PP Score = 2.701

<PUN> <PUN> it is amazing to me <PUN> <PUN> said bingley <PUN> <PUN> how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished <PUN> as they all are <PUN>    PP Score = 3.740
they all paint tables <PUN> cover skreens and net purses <PUN>    PP Score = 15.679

elizabeth <PUN> for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother <PUN> s thoughts <PUN> now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since <PUN> her <PUN> coming away <PUN>    PP Score = 3.039
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> that <PUN> is my idea of good breeding <PUN> and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths <PUN> quite mistake the matter <PUN>    PP Score = 2.461
not that <PUN> i <PUN> think charlotte so <PUN> very <PUN> plain <PUN> <PUN> but then she is our particular friend <PUN>    PP Score = 4.190
dear <PUN> yes <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> but you must own she is very plain <PUN>    PP Score = 6.330
<PUN> <PUN> and so ended his affection <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth impatiently <PUN>    PP Score = 5.560
<PUN> of a fine <PUN> stout <PUN> healthy love it may <PUN>    PP Score = 6.142
every thing nourishes what is strong already <PUN>    PP Score = 6.627
<PUN> darcy only smiled <PUN> and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again <PUN>    PP Score = 3.507
bingley for his kindness to jane <PUN> with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy <PUN>    PP Score = 4.614
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963

<PUN> <PUN> the indirect boast <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> for you are really proud of your defects in writing <PUN> because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution <PUN> which if not estimable <PUN> you think at least highly interesting <PUN>    PP Score = 2.426
<PUN> <PUN> nay <PUN> <PUN> cried bingley <PUN> <PUN> this is too much <PUN> to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning <PUN>    PP Score = 3.105
at least <PUN> therefore <PUN> i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies <PUN>    PP Score = 3.191
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know <PUN> and if <PUN> as you were mounting your horse <PUN> a friend were to say <PUN> <PUN> bingley <PUN> you had better stay till next week <PUN> <PUN> you would probably do it <PUN> you would probably not go <PUN> <PUN> and <PUN> at another word <PUN> might stay a month <PUN>    PP Score = 3.143
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself <PUN>    PP Score = 3.634
allowing the case <PUN> however <PUN> to stand according to your representation <PUN> you must remember <PUN> miss bennet <PUN> that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house <PUN> and the delay of his plan <PUN> has merely desired it <PUN> asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety <PUN>    PP Score = 2.868
darcy <PUN> to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection <PUN>    PP Score = 3.287

<PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.595
hurst sang with her sister <PUN> and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument <PUN> how frequently mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.797
she could only imagine however at last <PUN> that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible <PUN> according to his ideas of right <PUN> than in any other person present <PUN>    PP Score = 2.712
he repeated the question <PUN> with some surprise at her silence <PUN>    PP Score = 4.292
you wanted me <PUN> i know <PUN> to say <PUN> yes <PUN> <PUN> that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste <PUN> but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes <PUN> and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt <PUN>    PP Score = 4.671

hurst had therefore nothing to do <PUN> but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep <PUN>    PP Score = 3.718
miss bingley <PUN> s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.650

he was directly invited to join their party <PUN> but he declined it <PUN> observing <PUN> that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together <PUN> with either of which motives his joining them would interfere <PUN>    PP Score = 2.898
<PUN> i never heard any thing so abominable <PUN>    PP Score = 6.181

i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good <PUN>    PP Score = 4.456

darcy it was welcome intelligence <PUN> <PUN> elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough <PUN>    PP Score = 4.434
miss bingley <PUN> s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly <PUN> as well as her affection for jane <PUN> and when they parted <PUN> after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield <PUN> and embracing her most tenderly <PUN> she even shook hands with the former <PUN>    PP Score = 2.710
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660

<PUN> jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail <PUN>    PP Score = 3.718
<PUN> it certainly is a most iniquitous affair <PUN> <PUN> said mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.017
bennet <PUN>    PP Score = 30.946
<PUN> he must be an oddity <PUN> i think <PUN> <PUN> said she <PUN>    PP Score = 5.970

<PUN> <PUN> can he be a sensible man <PUN> sir <PUN>    PP Score = 4.317
as for their mother <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.321
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers <PUN> but mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.037

there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed <PUN>    PP Score = 2.991
bennet <PUN> s heart <PUN> but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property <PUN>    PP Score = 2.850

bennet <PUN> who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook <PUN> and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen <PUN>    PP Score = 4.179

<PUN> <PUN> she has one only daughter <PUN> the heiress of rosings <PUN> and of very extensive property <PUN>    PP Score = 4.514
and what sort of young lady is she <PUN>    PP Score = 4.934
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty <PUN> miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex <PUN> because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth <PUN>    PP Score = 2.351
but she is perfectly amiable <PUN> and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies <PUN>    PP Score = 2.726
bennet <PUN> <PUN> and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy <PUN>    PP Score = 3.218
by tea <PUN> time however the dose had been enough <PUN> and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.273
bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing <PUN> room again <PUN> and when tea was over <PUN> glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies <PUN>    PP Score = 3.040
lydia gaped as he opened the volume <PUN> and before he had <PUN> with very monotonous solemnity <PUN> read three pages <PUN> she interrupted him with <PUN> <PUN> do you know <PUN> mama <PUN> that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard <PUN> and if he does <PUN> colonel forster will hire him <PUN>    PP Score = 3.435
collins <PUN> much offended <PUN> laid aside his book <PUN> and said <PUN> <PUN> i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp <PUN> though written solely for their benefit <PUN>    PP Score = 2.633
it amazes me <PUN> i confess <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> for certainly <PUN> there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction <PUN>    PP Score = 4.605
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
collins <PUN> after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will <PUN> and should never resent her behaviour as any affront <PUN> seated himself at another table with mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.095
having now a good house and very sufficient income <PUN> he intended to marry <PUN> and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view <PUN> as he meant to chuse one of the daughters <PUN> if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report <PUN>    PP Score = 2.942
his plan did not vary on seeing them <PUN>    PP Score = 4.936

in pompous nothings on his side <PUN> and civil assents on that of his cousins <PUN> their time passed till they entered meryton <PUN>    PP Score = 3.610
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man <PUN> whom they had never seen before <PUN> of most gentleman <PUN> like appearance <PUN> walking with an officer on the other side of the way <PUN>    PP Score = 2.728
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
this was exactly as it should be <PUN> for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming <PUN>    PP Score = 3.854
bingley was the principal spokesman <PUN> and miss bennet the principal object <PUN>    PP Score = 5.383
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
wickham <PUN> after a few moments <PUN> touched his hat <PUN> <PUN> a salutation which mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.137

mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room <PUN> and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless <PUN>    PP Score = 4.319
as they walked home <PUN> elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen <PUN> but though jane would have defended either or both <PUN> had they appeared to be wrong <PUN> she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister <PUN>    PP Score = 2.998
philips <PUN> s manners and politeness <PUN>    PP Score = 7.196
collins <PUN> s scruples of leaving mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.693
wickham had accepted their uncle <PUN> s invitation <PUN> and was then in the house <PUN>    PP Score = 4.479
when the card tables were placed <PUN> he had an opportunity of obliging her in return <PUN> by sitting down to whist <PUN>    PP Score = 3.131
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963

allowing for the common demands of the game <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.652
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved <PUN>    PP Score = 6.045
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
darcy had been staying there <PUN>    PP Score = 7.971

<PUN> <PUN> are you much acquainted with mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.197
<PUN> <PUN> i have no right to give <PUN> my <PUN> opinion <PUN> <PUN> said wickham <PUN> <PUN> as to his being agreeable or otherwise <PUN>    PP Score = 4.810
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge <PUN>    PP Score = 4.807
it is impossible for <PUN> me <PUN> to be impartial <PUN>    PP Score = 7.019
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire <PUN>    PP Score = 6.773
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
society <PUN> i own <PUN> is necessary to me <PUN>    PP Score = 4.410
the church <PUN> ought <PUN> to have been my profession <PUN> <PUN> i was brought up for the church <PUN> and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living <PUN> had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now <PUN>    PP Score = 3.445
certain it is <PUN> that the living became vacant two years ago <PUN> exactly as i was of an age to hold it <PUN> and that it was given to another man <PUN> and no less certain is it <PUN> that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.392
<PUN> <PUN> some time or other he <PUN> will <PUN> be <PUN> <PUN> but it shall not be by <PUN> me <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 4.078

<PUN> <PUN> what can have induced him to behave so cruelly <PUN>    PP Score = 3.309
<PUN> <PUN> a thorough <PUN> determined dislike of me <PUN> <PUN> a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy <PUN>    PP Score = 3.979
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood <PUN> <PUN> the sort of preference which was often given me <PUN>    PP Score = 3.491
his disposition must be dreadful <PUN>    PP Score = 9.300
<PUN> <PUN> i will not trust myself on the subject <PUN> <PUN> replied wickham <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> i <PUN> can hardly be just to him <PUN>    PP Score = 4.412
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> she could have added <PUN> <PUN> a young man too <PUN> like <PUN> you <PUN> <PUN> whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> but she contented herself with <PUN> and one <PUN> too <PUN> who had probably been his own companion from childhood <PUN> connected together <PUN> as i think you said <PUN> in the closest manner <PUN>    PP Score = 4.037
philips <PUN> appears to do so much credit to <PUN> <PUN> but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.705
<PUN> <PUN> it <PUN> is <PUN> wonderful <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> replied wickham <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> for almost all his actions may be traced to pride <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> and pride has often been his best friend <PUN>    PP Score = 3.841
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling <PUN>    PP Score = 3.388
not to appear to disgrace his family <PUN> to degenerate from the popular qualities <PUN> or lose the influence of the pemberley house <PUN> is a powerful motive <PUN>    PP Score = 3.760
but she is too much like her brother <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> very <PUN> very proud <PUN>    PP Score = 5.933
<PUN> <PUN> as a child <PUN> she was affectionate and pleasing <PUN> and extremely fond of me <PUN> and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement <PUN>    PP Score = 3.794

he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while <PUN>    PP Score = 4.350

<PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.595
<PUN> elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it <PUN> and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards <PUN> and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.996
collins were once silent <PUN>    PP Score = 10.791
philips <PUN> protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist <PUN> enumerating all the dishes at supper <PUN> and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins <PUN> had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house <PUN>    PP Score = 2.964
<PUN> <PUN> the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness <PUN> was enough to interest all her tender feelings <PUN> and nothing therefore remained to be done <PUN> but to think well of them both <PUN> to defend the conduct of each <PUN> and throw into the account of accident or mistake <PUN> whatever could not be otherwise explained <PUN>    PP Score = 2.814
it is <PUN> in short <PUN> impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them <PUN> without actual blame on either side <PUN>    PP Score = 2.941
<PUN> <PUN> very true <PUN> indeed <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> and now <PUN> my dear jane <PUN> what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business <PUN>    PP Score = 3.222
<PUN> <PUN> i can much more easily believe mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.796
wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night <PUN> names <PUN> facts <PUN> every thing mentioned without ceremony <PUN>    PP Score = 3.697
darcy contradict it <PUN>    PP Score = 21.421
<PUN> <PUN> it is difficult indeed <PUN> <PUN> it is distressing <PUN>    PP Score = 6.335
<PUN> <PUN> i beg your pardon <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> one knows exactly what to think <PUN>    PP Score = 3.698
<PUN> but jane could think with certainty on only one point <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> that mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.580
they were soon gone again <PUN> rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise <PUN> and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 2.087
bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter <PUN> and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.311
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends <PUN> and the attentions of their brother <PUN> and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.067
wickham <PUN> he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them <PUN> and a ball was at any rate <PUN> a ball <PUN>    PP Score = 4.193
society has claims on us all <PUN> and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body <PUN>    PP Score = 3.449
<PUN> elizabeth felt herself completely taken in <PUN>    PP Score = 4.865
her liveliness had been never worse timed <PUN>    PP Score = 8.133
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
wickham <PUN> s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer <PUN> and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.389
collins <PUN> s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could <PUN>    PP Score = 4.199
the idea soon reached to conviction <PUN> as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself <PUN> and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity <PUN> and though more astonished than gratified herself <PUN> by this effect of her charms <PUN> it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to <PUN> her <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 2.636
no aunt <PUN> no officers <PUN> no news could be sought after <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> the very shoe <PUN> roses for netherfield were got by proxy <PUN>    PP Score = 4.745
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her <PUN>    PP Score = 3.627
the two first dances <PUN> however <PUN> brought a return of distress <PUN> they were dances of mortification <PUN>    PP Score = 3.719
<PUN> <PUN> heaven forbid <PUN>    PP Score = 10.144
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with <PUN> it is <PUN> your <PUN> turn to say something now <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.603
<PUN> he smiled <PUN> and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said <PUN>    PP Score = 3.538
one must speak a little <PUN> you know <PUN>    PP Score = 5.595
<PUN> <PUN> are you consulting your own feelings in the present case <PUN> or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine <PUN>    PP Score = 2.734
wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his <PUN> making <PUN> friends <PUN> <PUN> whether he may be equally capable of <PUN> retaining <PUN> them <PUN> is less certain <PUN>    PP Score = 2.665
<PUN> darcy made no answer <PUN> and seemed desirous of changing the subject <PUN>    PP Score = 3.189
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them <PUN> meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room <PUN> but on perceiving mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.232
darcy <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> but let me not interrupt you <PUN> sir <PUN>    PP Score = 5.732
recovering himself <PUN> however <PUN> shortly <PUN> he turned to his partner <PUN> and said <PUN> <PUN> sir william <PUN> s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of <PUN>    PP Score = 3.181
<PUN> said he <PUN> smiling <PUN>    PP Score = 9.812
<PUN> <PUN> i am sorry you think so <PUN> but if that be the case <PUN> there can at least be no want of subject <PUN>    PP Score = 3.174
darcy <PUN> that you hardly ever forgave <PUN> that your resentment once created was unappeasable <PUN>    PP Score = 5.786
<PUN> <PUN> i hope not <PUN>    PP Score = 8.693

her favourite walk <PUN> and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine <PUN> was along the open grove which edged that side of the park <PUN> where there was a nice sheltered path <PUN> which no one seemed to value but herself <PUN> and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine <PUN> s curiosity <PUN>    PP Score = 2.826

he seemed astonished too on finding her alone <PUN> and apologised for his intrusion <PUN> by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within <PUN>    PP Score = 2.743
they then sat down <PUN> and when her enquiries after rosings were made <PUN> seemed in danger of sinking into total silence <PUN>    PP Score = 2.995

<PUN> she found that she was to receive no other answer <PUN> <PUN> and <PUN> after a short pause <PUN> added <PUN> <PUN> i think i have understood that mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.732

darcy came so often to the parsonage <PUN> it was more difficult to understand <PUN>    PP Score = 4.438
colonel fitzwilliam <PUN> s occasionally laughing at his stupidity <PUN> proved that he was generally different <PUN> which her own knowledge of him could not have told her <PUN> and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love <PUN> and the object of that love <PUN> her friend eliza <PUN> she sat herself seriously to work to find it out <PUN>    PP Score = 2.961
<PUN> <PUN> she watched him whenever they were at rosings <PUN> and whenever he came to hunsford <PUN> but without much success <PUN>    PP Score = 3.696
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal <PUN> but the expression of that look was disputable <PUN>    PP Score = 5.467
it was an earnest <PUN> steadfast gaze <PUN> but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it <PUN> and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind <PUN>    PP Score = 3.595
collins did not think it right to press the subject <PUN> from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment <PUN> for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt <PUN> that all her friend <PUN> s dislike would vanish <PUN> if she could suppose him to be in her power <PUN>    PP Score = 3.227
<PUN> <PUN> she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought <PUN> and to prevent its ever happening again <PUN> took care to inform him at first <PUN> that it was a favourite haunt of hers <PUN>    PP Score = 3.022
<PUN> <PUN> how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd <PUN>    PP Score = 3.273
it seemed like wilful ill <PUN> nature <PUN> or a voluntary penance <PUN> for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away <PUN> but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her <PUN>    PP Score = 2.861

<PUN> <PUN> these are home questions <PUN> <PUN> and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature <PUN>    PP Score = 4.098
<PUN> and she coloured at the idea <PUN> but <PUN> recovering herself <PUN> said in a lively tone <PUN> <PUN> and pray <PUN> what is the usual price of an earl <PUN> s younger son <PUN>    PP Score = 3.432
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed <PUN> she soon afterwards said <PUN> <PUN> i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal <PUN>    PP Score = 2.585

collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine <PUN> s being rather displeased by her staying at home <PUN>    PP Score = 3.169
they contained no actual complaint <PUN> nor was there any revival of past occurrences <PUN> or any communication of present suffering <PUN>    PP Score = 3.511
darcy <PUN> s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict <PUN> gave her a keener sense of her sister <PUN> s sufferings <PUN>    PP Score = 3.602
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health <PUN> imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better <PUN>    PP Score = 3.262
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you <PUN>    PP Score = 3.604
this he considered sufficient encouragement <PUN> and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her <PUN> immediately followed <PUN>    PP Score = 4.053
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which <PUN> in spite of all his endeavours <PUN> he had found impossible to conquer <PUN> and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand <PUN>    PP Score = 3.002
<PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.595
his complexion became pale with anger <PUN> and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature <PUN>    PP Score = 3.143
the pause was to elizabeth <PUN> s feelings dreadful <PUN>    PP Score = 8.048
you dare not <PUN> you cannot deny that you have been the principal <PUN> if not the only means of dividing them from each other <PUN> of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability <PUN> the other to its derision for disappointed hopes <PUN> and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind <PUN>    PP Score = 2.977
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity <PUN>    PP Score = 5.407
<PUN> but it is not merely this affair <PUN> <PUN> she continued <PUN> <PUN> on which my dislike is founded <PUN>    PP Score = 4.623
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.751
wickham <PUN>    PP Score = 95.187
in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself <PUN>    PP Score = 3.421
<PUN> <PUN> you take an eager interest in that gentleman <PUN> s concerns <PUN> <PUN> said darcy in a less tranquil tone <PUN> and with a heightened colour <PUN>    PP Score = 3.412
you have deprived the best years of his life <PUN> of that independence which was no less his due than his desert <PUN>    PP Score = 3.200
this is the estimation in which you hold me <PUN>    PP Score = 4.477
i thank you for explaining it so fully <PUN>    PP Score = 4.701
but perhaps <PUN> <PUN> added he <PUN> stopping in his walk <PUN> and turning towards her <PUN> <PUN> these offences might have been overlooked <PUN> had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design <PUN>    PP Score = 2.731
she went on <PUN>    PP Score = 23.430
her astonishment <PUN> as she reflected on what had passed <PUN> was increased by every review of it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.159
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend <PUN> s marrying her sister <PUN> and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case <PUN> was almost incredible <PUN>    PP Score = 3.241
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection <PUN>    PP Score = 3.336
but his pride <PUN> his abominable pride <PUN> his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane <PUN> his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging <PUN> though he could not justify it <PUN> and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.862
wickham <PUN> his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny <PUN> soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited <PUN>    PP Score = 2.597
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened <PUN> it was impossible to think of any thing else <PUN> and totally indisposed for employment <PUN> she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise <PUN>    PP Score = 2.661

you must <PUN> therefore <PUN> pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention <PUN> your feelings <PUN> i know <PUN> will bestow it unwillingly <PUN> but i demand it of your justice <PUN>    PP Score = 3.094

but i shall not scruple to assert <PUN> that the serenity of your sister <PUN> s countenance and air was such <PUN> as might have given the most acute observer <PUN> a conviction that <PUN> however amiable her temper <PUN> her heart was not likely to be easily touched <PUN>    PP Score = 2.865
<PUN> <PUN> that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears <PUN>    PP Score = 4.043
<PUN> <PUN> my objections to the marriage were not merely those <PUN> which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside <PUN> in my own case <PUN> the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me <PUN>    PP Score = 2.448
<PUN> <PUN> the situation of your mother <PUN> s family <PUN> though objectionable <PUN> was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently <PUN> so almost uniformly betrayed by herself <PUN> by your three younger sisters <PUN> and occasionally even by your father <PUN>    PP Score = 2.543
<PUN> <PUN> i will only say farther <PUN> that from what passed that evening <PUN> my opinion of all parties was confirmed <PUN> and every inducement heightened <PUN> which could have led me before <PUN> to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection <PUN>    PP Score = 2.391
<PUN> <PUN> he left netherfield for london <PUN> on the day following <PUN> as you <PUN> i am certain <PUN> remember <PUN> with the design of soon returning <PUN>    PP Score = 4.148
<PUN> <PUN> the part which i acted <PUN> is now to be explained <PUN>    PP Score = 4.023
<PUN> <PUN> we accordingly went <PUN> <PUN> and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend <PUN> the certain evils of such a choice <PUN>    PP Score = 3.759
<PUN> <PUN> i described <PUN> and enforced them earnestly <PUN>    PP Score = 6.180
<PUN> <PUN> but <PUN> however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination <PUN> i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage <PUN> had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving <PUN> of your sister <PUN> s indifference <PUN>    PP Score = 3.153
<PUN> <PUN> to convince him <PUN> therefore <PUN> that he had deceived himself <PUN> was no very difficult point <PUN>    PP Score = 4.625
my father was not only fond of this young man <PUN> s society <PUN> whose manners were always engaging <PUN> he had also the highest opinion of him <PUN> and hoping the church would be his profession <PUN> intended to provide for him in it <PUN>    PP Score = 2.840
wickham was to the last so steady <PUN> that in his will he particularly recommended it to me <PUN> to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow <PUN> and if he took orders <PUN> desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant <PUN>    PP Score = 2.781
i rather wished <PUN> than believed him to be sincere <PUN> but at any rate <PUN> was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal <PUN>    PP Score = 3.593
the business was therefore soon settled <PUN>    PP Score = 6.867
i thought too ill of him <PUN> to invite him to pemberley <PUN> or admit his society in town <PUN>    PP Score = 3.417
how he lived i know not <PUN>    PP Score = 6.877
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice <PUN>    PP Score = 2.958
she was then but fifteen <PUN> which must be her excuse <PUN> and after stating her imprudence <PUN> i am happy to add <PUN> that i owed the knowledge of it to herself <PUN>    PP Score = 3.410
his revenge would have been complete indeed <PUN>    PP Score = 7.538
for the truth of every thing here related <PUN> i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam <PUN> who from our near relationship and constant intimacy <PUN> and still more as one of the executors of my father <PUN> s will <PUN> has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions <PUN>    PP Score = 2.732
astonishment <PUN> apprehension <PUN> and even horror <PUN> oppressed her <PUN>    PP Score = 4.468
this cannot be <PUN>    PP Score = 16.956
so far each recital confirmed the other <PUN> but when she came to the will <PUN> the difference was great <PUN>    PP Score = 3.668
again she read on <PUN>    PP Score = 13.111
darcy <PUN> s conduct in it less than infamous <PUN> was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole <PUN>    PP Score = 2.819

his fear of her <PUN> has always operated <PUN> i know <PUN> when they were together <PUN> and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh <PUN> which i am certain he has very much at heart <PUN>    PP Score = 4.101
