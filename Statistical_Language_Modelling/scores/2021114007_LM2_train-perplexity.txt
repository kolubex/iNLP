<PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.595
<PUN> but it is <PUN> <PUN> returned she <PUN> <PUN> for mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 7.043
long has just been here <PUN> and she told me all about it <PUN>    PP Score = 4.618
<PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.595
bennet made no answer <PUN>    PP Score = 8.412
<PUN> cried his wife impatiently <PUN>    PP Score = 8.622
<PUN> <PUN> you <PUN> want to tell me <PUN> and i have no objection to hearing it <PUN>    PP Score = 5.420
<PUN> this was invitation enough <PUN>    PP Score = 7.369
<PUN> why <PUN> my dear <PUN> you must know <PUN> mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 6.451
long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england <PUN> that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place <PUN> and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.741
<PUN> <PUN> what is his name <PUN>    PP Score = 6.625
<PUN> <PUN> is he married or single <PUN>    PP Score = 5.881
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
single <PUN> my dear <PUN> to be sure <PUN>    PP Score = 9.093
a single man of large fortune <PUN> four or five thousand a year <PUN>    PP Score = 3.783
<PUN> <PUN> how so <PUN>    PP Score = 11.546
how can it affect them <PUN>    PP Score = 8.607
<PUN> <PUN> my dear mr <PUN>    PP Score = 7.079
bennet <PUN> <PUN> replied his wife <PUN> <PUN> how can you be so tiresome <PUN>    PP Score = 5.190
<PUN> <PUN> is that his design in settling here <PUN>    PP Score = 4.197
<PUN> <PUN> design <PUN>    PP Score = 20.188
nonsense <PUN> how can you talk so <PUN>    PP Score = 5.968
but it is very likely that he <PUN> may <PUN> fall in love with one of them <PUN> and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes <PUN>    PP Score = 4.177
<PUN> <PUN> i see no occasion for that <PUN>    PP Score = 6.099
you and the girls may go <PUN> or you may send them by themselves <PUN> which perhaps will be still better <PUN> for as you are as handsome as any of them <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.774
bingley might like you the best of the party <PUN>    PP Score = 4.950
<PUN> <PUN> my dear <PUN> you flatter me <PUN>    PP Score = 4.695
i certainly <PUN> have <PUN> had my share of beauty <PUN> but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now <PUN>    PP Score = 4.266
when a woman has five grown up daughters <PUN> she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty <PUN>    PP Score = 3.233
<PUN> <PUN> in such cases <PUN> a woman has not often much beauty to think of <PUN>    PP Score = 3.158
bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood <PUN>    PP Score = 5.084
<PUN> <PUN> it is more than i engage for <PUN> i assure you <PUN>    PP Score = 3.878
indeed you must go <PUN> for it will be impossible for <PUN> us <PUN> to visit him <PUN> if you do not <PUN>    PP Score = 3.830
<PUN> <PUN> you are over scrupulous surely <PUN>    PP Score = 8.284
i dare say mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.951
bingley will be very glad to see you <PUN> and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls <PUN> though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy <PUN>    PP Score = 2.879
<PUN> <PUN> i desire you will do no such thing <PUN>    PP Score = 3.878
but you are always giving <PUN> her <PUN> the preference <PUN>    PP Score = 6.639
<PUN> <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.076
bennet <PUN> how can you abuse your own children in such a way <PUN>    PP Score = 4.098
you have no compassion on my poor nerves <PUN>    PP Score = 6.055
<PUN> <PUN> you mistake me <PUN> my dear <PUN>    PP Score = 4.090
i have a high respect for your nerves <PUN>    PP Score = 6.196
they are my old friends <PUN>    PP Score = 7.440
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least <PUN>    PP Score = 3.209
<PUN> <PUN> ah <PUN>    PP Score = 13.915
you do not know what i suffer <PUN>    PP Score = 8.769
<PUN> <PUN> but i hope you will get over it <PUN> and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood <PUN>    PP Score = 3.084
<PUN> <PUN> it will be no use to us <PUN> if twenty such should come since you will not visit them <PUN>    PP Score = 3.136
<PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.595
<PUN> her <PUN> mind was less difficult to develope <PUN>    PP Score = 8.669
she was a woman of mean understanding <PUN> little information <PUN> and uncertain temper <PUN>    PP Score = 3.841
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous <PUN>    PP Score = 4.586
bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.727
bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 56.540
he had always intended to visit him <PUN> though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go <PUN> and till the evening after the visit was paid <PUN> she had no knowledge of it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.123
it was then disclosed in the following manner <PUN>    PP Score = 6.125
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat <PUN> he suddenly addressed her with <PUN> <PUN> i hope mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.565
bingley will like it lizzy <PUN>    PP Score = 7.573
<PUN> <PUN> we are not in a way to know <PUN> what <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.982
bingley likes <PUN> <PUN> said her mother resentfully <PUN> <PUN> since we are not to visit <PUN>    PP Score = 4.292
<PUN> <PUN> but you forget <PUN> mama <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> that we shall meet him at the assemblies <PUN> and that mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.096
long has promised to introduce him <PUN>    PP Score = 6.079
<PUN> <PUN> i do not believe mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 5.786
long will do any such thing <PUN>    PP Score = 6.376
she has two nieces of her own <PUN>    PP Score = 4.986
<PUN> <PUN> no more have i <PUN> <PUN> said mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.659
<PUN> mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 23.213
bennet deigned not to make any reply <PUN> but unable to contain herself <PUN> began scolding one of her daughters <PUN>    PP Score = 2.772
<PUN> don <PUN> t keep coughing so <PUN> kitty <PUN> for heaven <PUN> s sake <PUN>    PP Score = 3.959
have a little compassion on my nerves <PUN>    PP Score = 7.551
you tear them to pieces <PUN>    PP Score = 8.134
<PUN> <PUN> kitty has no discretion in her coughs <PUN> <PUN> said her father <PUN> <PUN> she times them ill <PUN>    PP Score = 4.386
<PUN> <PUN> i do not cough for my own amusement <PUN> <PUN> replied kitty fretfully <PUN>    PP Score = 3.960
<PUN> when is your next ball to be <PUN> lizzy <PUN>    PP Score = 4.678
<PUN> <PUN> to <PUN> morrow fortnight <PUN>    PP Score = 11.143
<PUN> <PUN> then <PUN> my dear <PUN> you may have the advantage of your friend <PUN> and introduce mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.902
bingley to <PUN> her <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 7.622
<PUN> <PUN> impossible <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 6.863
bennet <PUN> impossible <PUN> when i am not acquainted with him myself <PUN> how can you be so teazing <PUN>    PP Score = 3.918
<PUN> <PUN> i honour your circumspection <PUN>    PP Score = 5.994
but if <PUN> we <PUN> do not venture <PUN> somebody else will <PUN> and after all <PUN> mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.091
long and her nieces must stand their chance <PUN> and therefore <PUN> as she will think it an act of kindness <PUN> if you decline the office <PUN> i will take it on myself <PUN>    PP Score = 3.033
<PUN> the girls stared at their father <PUN>    PP Score = 6.197
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
bennet said only <PUN> <PUN> nonsense <PUN> nonsense <PUN>    PP Score = 4.827
<PUN> do you consider the forms of introduction <PUN> and the stress that is laid on them <PUN> as nonsense <PUN>    PP Score = 3.203
i cannot quite agree with you <PUN> there <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 5.915
what say you <PUN> mary <PUN>    PP Score = 9.209
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know <PUN> and read great books <PUN> and make extracts <PUN>    PP Score = 4.500
<PUN> mary wished to say something very sensible <PUN> but knew not how <PUN>    PP Score = 3.535
bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 56.540
bingley <PUN> <PUN> cried his wife <PUN>    PP Score = 8.701
<PUN> i am sorry to hear <PUN> that <PUN> <PUN> but why did not you tell me so before <PUN>    PP Score = 5.268
if i had known as much this morning <PUN> i certainly would not have called on him <PUN>    PP Score = 4.293
it is very unlucky <PUN> but as i have actually paid the visit <PUN> we cannot escape the acquaintance now <PUN>    PP Score = 3.596
<PUN> the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished <PUN> that of mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.557
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest <PUN> though when the first tumult of joy was over <PUN> she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while <PUN>    PP Score = 3.579
<PUN> how good it was in you <PUN> my dear mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.153
but i knew i should persuade you at last <PUN>    PP Score = 4.908
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance <PUN>    PP Score = 3.000
<PUN> <PUN> now <PUN> kitty <PUN> you may cough as much as you chuse <PUN> <PUN> said mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.346
bennet <PUN> and <PUN> as he spoke <PUN> he left the room <PUN> fatigued with the raptures of his wife <PUN>    PP Score = 4.200
<PUN> i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness <PUN> or me either <PUN> for that matter <PUN>    PP Score = 2.836
at our time of life <PUN> it is not so pleasant i can tell you <PUN> to be making new acquaintance every day <PUN> but for your sakes <PUN> we would do any thing <PUN>    PP Score = 3.457
bingley will dance with you at the next ball <PUN>    PP Score = 4.927
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
<PUN> said lydia stoutly <PUN> <PUN> i am not afraid <PUN> for though i <PUN> am <PUN> the youngest <PUN> i <PUN> m the tallest <PUN>    PP Score = 6.243
<PUN> the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.689
chapter iii <PUN>    PP Score = 50.982
not all that mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 14.798
bennet <PUN> however <PUN> with the assistance of her five daughters <PUN> could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.229
bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 56.540
they attacked him in various ways <PUN> with barefaced questions <PUN> ingenious suppositions <PUN> and distant surmises <PUN> but he eluded the skill of them all <PUN> and they were at last obliged to accept the second <PUN> hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas <PUN>    PP Score = 3.293
her report was highly favourable <PUN>    PP Score = 7.910
sir william had been delighted with him <PUN>    PP Score = 4.857
nothing could be more delightful <PUN>    PP Score = 12.430
to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love <PUN> and very lively hopes of mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.988
bingley <PUN> s heart were entertained <PUN>    PP Score = 7.263
bennet to her husband <PUN> <PUN> and all the others equally well married <PUN> i shall have nothing to wish for <PUN>    PP Score = 5.700
<PUN> in a few days mr <PUN>    PP Score = 14.034
bingley returned mr <PUN>    PP Score = 21.773
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies <PUN> of whose beauty he had heard much <PUN> but he saw only the father <PUN>    PP Score = 3.255
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate <PUN> for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window <PUN> that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse <PUN>    PP Score = 3.188
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched <PUN> and already had mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.489
bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping <PUN> when an answer arrived which deferred it all <PUN>    PP Score = 2.327
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
bingley was obliged to be in town the following day <PUN> and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation <PUN> <PUN> c <PUN>    PP Score = 4.117
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
bennet was quite disconcerted <PUN>    PP Score = 11.696
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball <PUN> and a report soon followed that mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.535
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies <PUN> but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing <PUN> that instead of twelve <PUN> he had brought only six with him from london <PUN> his five sisters and a cousin <PUN>    PP Score = 2.584
and when the party entered the assembly room <PUN> it consisted of only five altogether <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.042
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
bingley was good looking and gentleman <PUN> like <PUN> he had a pleasant countenance <PUN> and easy <PUN> unaffected manners <PUN>    PP Score = 3.880
his sisters were fine women <PUN> with an air of decided fashion <PUN>    PP Score = 4.028
his brother <PUN> in <PUN> law <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.432
hurst <PUN> merely looked the gentleman <PUN> but his friend mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.701
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room <PUN> he was lively and unreserved <PUN> danced every dance <PUN> was angry that the ball closed so early <PUN> and talked of giving one himself at netherfield <PUN>    PP Score = 2.524
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves <PUN>    PP Score = 5.296
what a contrast between him and his friend <PUN>    PP Score = 5.654
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
darcy danced only once with mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 5.872
hurst and once with miss bingley <PUN> declined being introduced to any other lady <PUN> and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room <PUN> speaking occasionally to one of his own party <PUN>    PP Score = 3.159
his character was decided <PUN>    PP Score = 13.065
he was the proudest <PUN> most disagreeable man in the world <PUN> and every body hoped that he would never come there again <PUN>    PP Score = 3.707
bennet <PUN> whose dislike of his general behaviour <PUN> was sharpened into particular resentment <PUN> by his having slighted one of her daughters <PUN>    PP Score = 2.607
elizabeth bennet had been obliged <PUN> by the scarcity of gentlemen <PUN> to sit down for two dances <PUN> and during part of that time <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.936
bingley <PUN> who came from the dance for a few minutes <PUN> to press his friend to join it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.322
you had much better dance <PUN>    PP Score = 10.120
you know how i detest it <PUN> unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner <PUN>    PP Score = 3.577
at such an assembly as this <PUN> it would be insupportable <PUN>    PP Score = 5.545
upon my honour <PUN> i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life <PUN> as i have this evening <PUN> and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty <PUN>    PP Score = 3.359
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> you <PUN> are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room <PUN> <PUN> said mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.346
darcy <PUN> looking at the eldest miss bennet <PUN>    PP Score = 4.556
<PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 22.415
do let me ask my partner to introduce you <PUN>    PP Score = 3.994
<PUN> <PUN> which do you mean <PUN>    PP Score = 8.562
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles <PUN> for you are wasting your time with me <PUN>    PP Score = 3.264
bingley followed his advice <PUN>    PP Score = 11.299
darcy walked off <PUN> and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him <PUN>    PP Score = 3.815
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends <PUN> for she had a lively <PUN> playful disposition <PUN> which delighted in any thing ridiculous <PUN>    PP Score = 2.973
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family <PUN>    PP Score = 3.703
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party <PUN>    PP Score = 3.527
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
bingley had danced with her twice <PUN> and she had been distinguished by his sisters <PUN>    PP Score = 3.963
jane was as much gratified by this <PUN> as her mother could be <PUN> though in a quieter way <PUN>    PP Score = 4.697
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood <PUN> and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners <PUN> which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball <PUN>    PP Score = 2.795
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn <PUN> the village where they lived <PUN> and of which they were the principal inhabitants <PUN>    PP Score = 3.330
they found mr <PUN>    PP Score = 22.944
with a book he was regardless of time <PUN> and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations <PUN>    PP Score = 3.304
he had rather hoped that all his wife <PUN> s views on the stranger would be disappointed <PUN> but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear <PUN>    PP Score = 3.378
<PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 22.415
my dear mr <PUN>    PP Score = 17.551
bennet <PUN> <PUN> as she entered the room <PUN> <PUN> we have had a most delightful evening <PUN> a most excellent ball <PUN>    PP Score = 5.505
i wish you had been there <PUN>    PP Score = 6.999
jane was so admired <PUN> nothing could be like it <PUN>    PP Score = 4.151
every body said how well she looked <PUN> and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.116
only think of <PUN> that <PUN> my dear <PUN> he actually danced with her twice <PUN> and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time <PUN>    PP Score = 3.643
first of all <PUN> he asked miss lucas <PUN>    PP Score = 6.419
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her <PUN> but <PUN> however <PUN> he did not admire her at all <PUN> indeed <PUN> nobody can <PUN> you know <PUN> and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance <PUN>    PP Score = 3.938
then <PUN> the two third he danced with miss king <PUN> and the two fourth with maria lucas <PUN> and the two fifth with jane again <PUN> and the two sixth with lizzy <PUN> and the boulanger <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> if he had had any compassion for <PUN> me <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> cried her husband impatiently <PUN> <PUN> he would not have danced half so much <PUN>    PP Score = 4.281
for god <PUN> s sake <PUN> say no more of his partners <PUN>    PP Score = 5.739
oh <PUN>    PP Score = 341.807
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
my dear <PUN> <PUN> continued mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 7.593
bennet <PUN> <PUN> i am quite delighted with him <PUN>    PP Score = 7.786
he is so excessively handsome <PUN>    PP Score = 10.150
and his sisters are charming women <PUN>    PP Score = 8.096
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses <PUN>    PP Score = 4.815
hurst <PUN> s gown <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> here she was interrupted again <PUN>    PP Score = 4.900
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
bennet protested against any description of finery <PUN>    PP Score = 4.602
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject <PUN> and related <PUN> with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration <PUN> the shocking rudeness of mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.600
darcy <PUN>    PP Score = 26.572
<PUN> but i can assure you <PUN> <PUN> she added <PUN> <PUN> that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting <PUN> his <PUN> fancy <PUN> for he is a most disagreeable <PUN> horrid man <PUN> not at all worth pleasing <PUN>    PP Score = 3.929
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him <PUN>    PP Score = 5.324
he walked here <PUN> and he walked there <PUN> fancying himself so very great <PUN>    PP Score = 4.573
not handsome enough to dance with <PUN>    PP Score = 6.300
i wish you had been there <PUN> my dear <PUN> to have given him one of your set downs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.854
<PUN> chapter iv <PUN>    PP Score = 16.369
bingley before <PUN> expressed to her sister how very much she admired him <PUN>    PP Score = 3.560
<PUN> <PUN> so much ease <PUN> with such perfect good breeding <PUN>    PP Score = 4.407
<PUN> <PUN> he is also handsome <PUN> <PUN> replied elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> which a young man ought likewise to be <PUN> if he possibly can <PUN>    PP Score = 4.344
his character is thereby complete <PUN>    PP Score = 7.816
<PUN> <PUN> i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time <PUN>    PP Score = 3.150
i did not expect such a compliment <PUN>    PP Score = 7.346
<PUN> <PUN> did not you <PUN>    PP Score = 8.780
<PUN> i <PUN> did for you <PUN>    PP Score = 8.455
but that is one great difference between us <PUN>    PP Score = 4.543
he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room <PUN>    PP Score = 3.071
no thanks to his gallantry for that <PUN>    PP Score = 5.763
well <PUN> he certainly is very agreeable <PUN> and i give you leave to like him <PUN>    PP Score = 4.182
you have liked many a stupider person <PUN>    PP Score = 9.139
<PUN> <PUN> dear lizzy <PUN>    PP Score = 11.762
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes <PUN>    PP Score = 4.144
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life <PUN>    PP Score = 3.685
<PUN> <PUN> i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one <PUN> but i always speak what i think <PUN>    PP Score = 4.638
<PUN> <PUN> i know you do <PUN> and it is <PUN> that <PUN> which makes the wonder <PUN>    PP Score = 5.734
with <PUN> your <PUN> good sense <PUN> to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others <PUN>    PP Score = 4.396
affectation of candour is common enough <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> one meets it every where <PUN>    PP Score = 3.939
but to be candid without ostentation or design <PUN> <PUN> to take the good of every body <PUN> s character and make it still better <PUN> and say nothing of the bad <PUN> <PUN> belongs to you alone <PUN>    PP Score = 3.359
and so <PUN> you like this man <PUN> s sisters too <PUN> do you <PUN>    PP Score = 3.566
their manners are not equal to his <PUN>    PP Score = 6.148
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house <PUN> and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her <PUN>    PP Score = 3.326
they were in fact very fine ladies <PUN> not deficient in good humour when they were pleased <PUN> nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it <PUN> but proud and conceited <PUN>    PP Score = 2.671
they were rather handsome <PUN> had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town <PUN> had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds <PUN> were in the habit of spending more than they ought <PUN> and of associating with people of rank <PUN> and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves <PUN> and meanly of others <PUN>    PP Score = 2.983
bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father <PUN> who had intended to purchase an estate <PUN> but did not live to do it <PUN>    PP Score = 2.601
<PUN> <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.076
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own <PUN> but though he was now established only as a tenant <PUN> miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table <PUN> nor was mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.522
hurst <PUN> who had married a man of more fashion than fortune <PUN> less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her <PUN>    PP Score = 2.674
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
bingley had not been of age two years <PUN> when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house <PUN>    PP Score = 3.229
he did look at it and into it for half an hour <PUN> was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms <PUN> satisfied with what the owner said in its praise <PUN> and took it immediately <PUN>    PP Score = 2.439
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship <PUN> in spite of a great opposition of character <PUN>    PP Score = 4.112
on the strength of darcy <PUN> s regard bingley had the firmest reliance <PUN> and of his judgment the highest opinion <PUN>    PP Score = 3.591
in understanding darcy was the superior <PUN>    PP Score = 6.399
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage <PUN>    PP Score = 4.795
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared <PUN> darcy was continually giving offence <PUN>    PP Score = 3.053
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic <PUN>    PP Score = 3.824
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life <PUN> every body had been most kind and attentive to him <PUN> there had been no formality <PUN> no stiffness <PUN> he had soon felt acquainted with all the room <PUN> and as to miss bennet <PUN> he could not conceive an angel more beautiful <PUN>    PP Score = 2.955
darcy <PUN> on the contrary <PUN> had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion <PUN> for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest <PUN> and from none received either attention or pleasure <PUN>    PP Score = 2.595
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty <PUN> but she smiled too much <PUN>    PP Score = 4.072
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl <PUN> and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose <PUN>    PP Score = 2.907
chapter v <PUN>    PP Score = 61.564
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate <PUN>    PP Score = 3.062
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton <PUN> where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king <PUN> during his mayoralty <PUN>    PP Score = 3.044
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town <PUN> and quitting them both <PUN> he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton <PUN> denominated from that period lucas lodge <PUN> where he could think with pleasure of his own importance <PUN> and unshackled by business <PUN> occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world <PUN>    PP Score = 2.624
james <PUN> s had made him courteous <PUN>    PP Score = 8.069
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman <PUN> not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.605
bennet <PUN>    PP Score = 30.946
<PUN> <PUN> they had several children <PUN>    PP Score = 7.809
the eldest of them <PUN> a sensible <PUN> intelligent young woman <PUN> about twenty <PUN> seven <PUN> was elizabeth <PUN> s intimate friend <PUN>    PP Score = 4.021
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary <PUN> and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate <PUN>    PP Score = 2.936
<PUN> <PUN> you <PUN> began the evening well <PUN> charlotte <PUN> <PUN> said mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.393
bennet with civil self <PUN> command to miss lucas <PUN>    PP Score = 3.690
<PUN> <PUN> you <PUN> were mr <PUN>    PP Score = 7.502
bingley <PUN> s first choice <PUN>    PP Score = 10.432
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> but he seemed to like his second better <PUN>    PP Score = 5.018
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
<PUN> <PUN> you mean jane <PUN> i suppose <PUN> <PUN> because he danced with her twice <PUN>    PP Score = 4.181
to be sure that <PUN> did <PUN> seem as if he admired her <PUN> <PUN> indeed i rather believe he <PUN> did <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> i heard something about it <PUN> <PUN> but i hardly know what <PUN> <PUN> something about mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.363
robinson <PUN>    PP Score = 2506.477
robinson <PUN> did not i mention it to you <PUN>    PP Score = 5.935
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
robinson <PUN> s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies <PUN> and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room <PUN> and <PUN> which <PUN> he thought the prettiest <PUN>    PP Score = 3.850
and his answering immediately to the last question <PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 4.205
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt <PUN> there cannot be two opinions on that point <PUN>    PP Score = 3.084
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> my <PUN> overhearings were more to the purpose than <PUN> yours <PUN> <PUN> eliza <PUN> <PUN> said charlotte <PUN>    PP Score = 5.573
<PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.595
darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend <PUN> is he <PUN>    PP Score = 4.024
<PUN> <PUN> poor eliza <PUN>    PP Score = 10.211
<PUN> <PUN> to be only just <PUN> tolerable <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 5.046
<PUN> <PUN> i beg you would not put it into lizzy <PUN> s head to be vexed by his ill <PUN> treatment <PUN> for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him <PUN>    PP Score = 2.755
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips <PUN>    PP Score = 2.818
<PUN> <PUN> are you quite sure <PUN> ma <PUN> am <PUN>    PP Score = 3.433
<PUN> said jane <PUN>    PP Score = 16.141
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> i certainly saw mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.657
darcy speaking to her <PUN>    PP Score = 11.362
<PUN> <PUN> aye <PUN> <PUN> because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield <PUN> and he could not help answering her <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to <PUN>    PP Score = 4.000
<PUN> <PUN> miss bingley told me <PUN> <PUN> said jane <PUN> <PUN> that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance <PUN>    PP Score = 4.167
with <PUN> them <PUN> he is remarkably agreeable <PUN>    PP Score = 9.142
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 5.178
long <PUN>    PP Score = 501.316
but i can guess how it was <PUN> every body says that he is ate up with pride <PUN> and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.704
long does not keep a carriage <PUN> and had come to the ball in a hack chaise <PUN>    PP Score = 4.432
<PUN> <PUN> i do not mind his not talking to mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.639
long <PUN> <PUN> said miss lucas <PUN> <PUN> but i wish he had danced with eliza <PUN>    PP Score = 5.357
<PUN> <PUN> i believe <PUN> ma <PUN> am <PUN> i may safely promise you <PUN> never <PUN> to dance with him <PUN>    PP Score = 3.199
<PUN> <PUN> his pride <PUN> <PUN> said miss lucas <PUN> <PUN> does not offend <PUN> me <PUN> so much as pride often does <PUN> because there is an excuse for it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.744
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man <PUN> with family <PUN> fortune <PUN> every thing in his favour <PUN> should think highly of himself <PUN>    PP Score = 3.148
if i may so express it <PUN> he has a <PUN> right <PUN> to be proud <PUN>    PP Score = 5.280
<PUN> <PUN> that is very true <PUN> <PUN> replied elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> and i could easily forgive <PUN> his <PUN> pride <PUN> if he had not mortified <PUN> mine <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 3.995
<PUN> <PUN> pride <PUN> <PUN> observed mary <PUN> who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections <PUN> <PUN> is a very common failing i believe <PUN>    PP Score = 3.654
by all that i have ever read <PUN> i am convinced that it is very common indeed <PUN> that human nature is particularly prone to it <PUN> and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self <PUN> complacency on the score of some quality or other <PUN> real or imaginary <PUN>    PP Score = 3.095
a person may be proud without being vain <PUN>    PP Score = 5.884
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves <PUN> vanity to what we would have others think of us <PUN>    PP Score = 2.512
darcy <PUN> <PUN> cried a young lucas who came with his sisters <PUN> <PUN> i should not care how proud i was <PUN>    PP Score = 3.699
i would keep a pack of foxhounds <PUN> and drink a bottle of wine every day <PUN>    PP Score = 3.230
<PUN> <PUN> then you would drink a great deal more than you ought <PUN> <PUN> said mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.493
bennet <PUN> <PUN> and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly <PUN>    PP Score = 3.809
<PUN> the boy protested that she should not <PUN> she continued to declare that she would <PUN> and the argument ended only with the visit <PUN>    PP Score = 4.020
chapter vi <PUN>    PP Score = 61.564
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield <PUN>    PP Score = 4.304
the visit was returned in due form <PUN>    PP Score = 6.254
miss bennet <PUN> s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.744
hurst and miss bingley <PUN> and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to <PUN> a wish of being better acquainted with <PUN> them <PUN> <PUN> was expressed towards the two eldest <PUN>    PP Score = 2.738
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure <PUN> but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body <PUN> hardly excepting even her sister <PUN> and could not like them <PUN> though their kindness to jane <PUN> such as it was <PUN> had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother <PUN> s admiration <PUN>    PP Score = 3.014
it was generally evident whenever they met <PUN> that he <PUN> did <PUN> admire her <PUN> and to <PUN> her <PUN> it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first <PUN> and was in a way to be very much in love <PUN> but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general <PUN> since jane united with great strength of feeling <PUN> a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner <PUN> which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent <PUN>    PP Score = 2.952
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas <PUN>    PP Score = 5.321
<PUN> it may perhaps be pleasant <PUN> <PUN> replied charlotte <PUN> <PUN> to be able to impose on the public in such a case <PUN> but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded <PUN>    PP Score = 3.766
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it <PUN> she may lose the opportunity of fixing him <PUN> and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark <PUN>    PP Score = 3.451
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment <PUN> that it is not safe to leave any to itself <PUN>    PP Score = 3.337
we can all <PUN> begin <PUN> freely <PUN> <PUN> a slight preference is natural enough <PUN> but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement <PUN>    PP Score = 2.951
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly <PUN> but he may never do more than like her <PUN> if she does not help him on <PUN>    PP Score = 3.091
<PUN> <PUN> but she does help him on <PUN> as much as her nature will allow <PUN>    PP Score = 3.474
if <PUN> i <PUN> can perceive her regard for him <PUN> he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too <PUN>    PP Score = 4.105
<PUN> <PUN> remember <PUN> eliza <PUN> that he does not know jane <PUN> s disposition as you do <PUN>    PP Score = 5.368
<PUN> <PUN> but if a woman is partial to a man <PUN> and does not endeavour to conceal it <PUN> he must find it out <PUN>    PP Score = 3.400
<PUN> <PUN> perhaps he must <PUN> if he sees enough of her <PUN>    PP Score = 4.191
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often <PUN> it is never for many hours together <PUN> and as they always see each other in large mixed parties <PUN> it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together <PUN>    PP Score = 2.900
but these are not jane <PUN> s feelings <PUN> she is not acting by design <PUN>    PP Score = 5.065
as yet <PUN> she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard <PUN> nor of its reasonableness <PUN>    PP Score = 3.696
she has known him only a fortnight <PUN>    PP Score = 6.019
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character <PUN>    PP Score = 5.216
<PUN> <PUN> not as you represent it <PUN>    PP Score = 5.175
had she merely <PUN> dined <PUN> with him <PUN> she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite <PUN> but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together <PUN> <PUN> and four evenings may do a great deal <PUN>    PP Score = 2.960
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt <PUN> un better than commerce <PUN> but with respect to any other leading characteristic <PUN> i do not imagine that much has been unfolded <PUN>    PP Score = 3.186
<PUN> <PUN> well <PUN> <PUN> said charlotte <PUN> <PUN> i wish jane success with all my heart <PUN> and if she were married to him to <PUN> morrow <PUN> i should think she had as good a chance of happiness <PUN> as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth <PUN>    PP Score = 3.466
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance <PUN>    PP Score = 4.451
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other <PUN> or ever so similar before <PUN> hand <PUN> it does not advance their felicity in the least <PUN>    PP Score = 2.617
<PUN> <PUN> you make me laugh <PUN> charlotte <PUN> but it is not sound <PUN>    PP Score = 4.735
you know it is not sound <PUN> and that you would never act in this way yourself <PUN>    PP Score = 4.679
<PUN> occupied in observing mr <PUN>    PP Score = 7.466
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face <PUN> than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes <PUN>    PP Score = 2.566
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying <PUN>    PP Score = 4.322
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form <PUN> he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing <PUN> and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world <PUN> he was caught by their easy playfulness <PUN>    PP Score = 3.264
of this she was perfectly unaware <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where <PUN> and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with <PUN>    PP Score = 3.674
he began to wish to know more of her <PUN> and as a step towards conversing with her himself <PUN> attended to her conversation with others <PUN>    PP Score = 3.514
<PUN> what does mr <PUN>    PP Score = 11.854
darcy mean <PUN> <PUN> said she to charlotte <PUN> <PUN> by listening to my conversation with colonel forster <PUN>    PP Score = 4.153
<PUN> <PUN> that is a question which mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.662
darcy only can answer <PUN>    PP Score = 11.597
<PUN> <PUN> but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about <PUN>    PP Score = 3.226
he has a very satirical eye <PUN> and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself <PUN> i shall soon grow afraid of him <PUN>    PP Score = 4.286
<PUN> on his approaching them soon afterwards <PUN> though without seeming to have any intention of speaking <PUN> miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him <PUN> which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it <PUN> she turned to him and said <PUN> <PUN> did not you think <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.095
darcy <PUN> that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now <PUN> when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton <PUN>    PP Score = 3.347
<PUN> <PUN> with great energy <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic <PUN>    PP Score = 5.895
<PUN> <PUN> you are severe on us <PUN>    PP Score = 4.921
<PUN> <PUN> it will be <PUN> her <PUN> turn soon to be teazed <PUN> <PUN> said miss lucas <PUN>    PP Score = 3.864
<PUN> i am going to open the instrument <PUN> eliza <PUN> and you know what follows <PUN>    PP Score = 4.579
<PUN> <PUN> you are a very strange creature by way of a friend <PUN>    PP Score = 3.655
<PUN> <PUN> always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body <PUN>    PP Score = 2.794
<PUN> <PUN> if my vanity had taken a musical turn <PUN> you would have been invaluable <PUN> but as it is <PUN> i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers <PUN>    PP Score = 3.454
<PUN> on miss lucas <PUN> s persevering <PUN> however <PUN> she added <PUN> <PUN> very well <PUN> if it must be so <PUN> it must <PUN>    PP Score = 5.215
<PUN> and gravely glancing at mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.630
darcy <PUN> <PUN> there is a fine old saying <PUN> which every body here is of course familiar with <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> keep your breath to cool your porridge <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> and i shall keep mine to swell my song <PUN>    PP Score = 3.751
<PUN> her performance was pleasing <PUN> though by no means capital <PUN>    PP Score = 4.106
after a song or two <PUN> and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again <PUN> she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary <PUN> who having <PUN> in consequence of being the only plain one in the family <PUN> worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments <PUN> was always impatient for display <PUN>    PP Score = 2.525
elizabeth <PUN> easy and unaffected <PUN> had been listened to with much more pleasure <PUN> though not playing half so well <PUN> and mary <PUN> at the end of a long concerto <PUN> was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs <PUN> at the request of her younger sisters <PUN> who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room <PUN>    PP Score = 2.839
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
<PUN> what a charming amusement for young people this is <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.620
darcy <PUN>    PP Score = 26.572
<PUN> <PUN> there is nothing like dancing after all <PUN>    PP Score = 4.294
<PUN> <PUN> i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies <PUN>    PP Score = 4.640
<PUN> <PUN> certainly <PUN> sir <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world <PUN>    PP Score = 3.635
<PUN> <PUN> every savage can dance <PUN>    PP Score = 8.972
<PUN> sir william only smiled <PUN>    PP Score = 10.185
<PUN> your friend performs delightfully <PUN> <PUN> he continued after a pause <PUN> on seeing bingley join the group <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.093
darcy <PUN>    PP Score = 26.572
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> indeed <PUN> and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight <PUN>    PP Score = 4.046
do you often dance at st <PUN>    PP Score = 6.132
james <PUN> s <PUN>    PP Score = 10.864
<PUN> <PUN> never <PUN> sir <PUN>    PP Score = 9.033
<PUN> <PUN> do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place <PUN>    PP Score = 5.020
<PUN> <PUN> it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it <PUN>    PP Score = 2.938
darcy bowed <PUN>    PP Score = 87.629
<PUN> i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself <PUN> <PUN> for i am fond of superior society <PUN> but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas <PUN>    PP Score = 2.966
<PUN> he paused in hopes of an answer <PUN> but his companion was not disposed to make any <PUN> and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them <PUN> he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing <PUN> and called out to her <PUN> <PUN> my dear miss eliza <PUN> why are not you dancing <PUN>    PP Score = 3.505
<PUN> <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.076
darcy <PUN> you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner <PUN>    PP Score = 3.598

<PUN> and taking her hand <PUN> he would have given it to mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.459
darcy <PUN> who <PUN> though extremely surprised <PUN> was not unwilling to receive it <PUN> when she instantly drew back <PUN> and said with some discomposure to sir william <PUN> <PUN> indeed <PUN> sir <PUN> i have not the least intention of dancing <PUN>    PP Score = 3.614
<PUN> <PUN> i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner <PUN>    PP Score = 2.890
<PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.595
darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand <PUN> but in vain <PUN>    PP Score = 3.378
elizabeth was determined <PUN> nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion <PUN>    PP Score = 2.721
<PUN> you excel so much in the dance <PUN> miss eliza <PUN> that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you <PUN> and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general <PUN> he can have no objection <PUN> i am sure <PUN> to oblige us for one half hour <PUN>    PP Score = 3.381
<PUN> he is indeed <PUN> <PUN> but considering the inducement <PUN> my dear miss eliza <PUN> we cannot wonder at his complaisance <PUN> for who would object to such a partner <PUN>    PP Score = 3.667
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman <PUN> and he was thinking of her with some complacency <PUN> when thus accosted by miss bingley <PUN> <PUN> i can guess the subject of your reverie <PUN>    PP Score = 3.931
<PUN> <PUN> i should imagine not <PUN>    PP Score = 6.913
<PUN> <PUN> you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner <PUN> <PUN> in such society <PUN> and indeed i am quite of your opinion <PUN>    PP Score = 3.320
i was never more annoyed <PUN>    PP Score = 18.393
the insipidity and yet the noise <PUN> the nothingness and yet the self <PUN> importance of all these people <PUN>    PP Score = 3.539
<PUN> <PUN> what would i give to hear your strictures on them <PUN>    PP Score = 4.427
<PUN> <PUN> your conjecture is totally wrong <PUN> i assure you <PUN>    PP Score = 3.052
my mind was more agreeably engaged <PUN>    PP Score = 6.312
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow <PUN>    PP Score = 2.852
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963

how long has she been such a favourite <PUN>    PP Score = 5.513
<PUN> <PUN> and pray when am i to wish you joy <PUN>    PP Score = 3.889
<PUN> <PUN> that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask <PUN>    PP Score = 3.383
a lady <PUN> s imagination is very rapid <PUN> it jumps from admiration to love <PUN> from love to matrimony in a moment <PUN>    PP Score = 3.559
i knew you would be wishing me joy <PUN>    PP Score = 5.147
<PUN> <PUN> nay <PUN> if you are so serious about it <PUN> i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled <PUN>    PP Score = 4.533
you will have a charming mother <PUN> in <PUN> law <PUN> indeed <PUN> and of course she will be always at pemberley with you <PUN>    PP Score = 4.064

bennet <PUN> s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year <PUN> which <PUN> unfortunately for his daughters <PUN> was entailed in default of heirs male <PUN> on a distant relation <PUN> and their mother <PUN> s fortune <PUN> though ample for her situation in life <PUN> could but ill supply the deficiency of his <PUN>    PP Score = 2.741

the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton <PUN> a most convenient distance for the young ladies <PUN> who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week <PUN> to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner <PUN> s shop just over the way <PUN>    PP Score = 2.575
the two youngest of the family <PUN> catherine and lydia <PUN> were particularly frequent in these attentions <PUN> their minds were more vacant than their sisters <PUN> <PUN> and when nothing better offered <PUN> a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening <PUN> and however bare of news the country in general might be <PUN> they always contrived to learn some from their aunt <PUN>    PP Score = 2.396
at present <PUN> indeed <PUN> they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood <PUN> it was to remain the whole winter <PUN> and meryton was the head quarters <PUN>    PP Score = 2.882
their visits to mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 11.661
philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence <PUN>    PP Score = 6.732
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers <PUN> names and connections <PUN>    PP Score = 3.442
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
philips visited them all <PUN> and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before <PUN>    PP Score = 3.389
they could talk of nothing but officers <PUN> and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.511
bingley <PUN> s large fortune <PUN> the mention of which gave animation to their mother <PUN> was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign <PUN>    PP Score = 2.725
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.599
bennet coolly observed <PUN> <PUN> from all that i can collect by your manner of talking <PUN> you must be two of the silliest girls in the country <PUN>    PP Score = 3.804
i have suspected it some time <PUN> but i am now convinced <PUN>    PP Score = 6.203
<PUN> i am astonished <PUN> my dear <PUN> <PUN> said mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 5.310
bennet <PUN> <PUN> that you should be so ready to think your own children silly <PUN>    PP Score = 4.833
if i wished to think slightingly of any body <PUN> s children <PUN> it should not be of my own however <PUN>    PP Score = 4.210
<PUN> <PUN> if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.080
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> <PUN> but as it happens <PUN> they are all of them very clever <PUN>    PP Score = 4.371
<PUN> <PUN> this is the only point <PUN> i flatter myself <PUN> on which we do not agree <PUN>    PP Score = 3.585
<PUN> <PUN> my dear mr <PUN>    PP Score = 7.079
bennet <PUN> you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother <PUN>    PP Score = 4.084
<PUN> <PUN> when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do <PUN>    PP Score = 3.135
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well <PUN> <PUN> and indeed so i do still at my heart <PUN> and if a smart young colonel <PUN> with five or six thousand a year <PUN> should want one of my girls <PUN> i shall not say nay to him <PUN> and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william <PUN> s in his regimentals <PUN>    PP Score = 2.735
<PUN> <PUN> mama <PUN> <PUN> cried lydia <PUN> <PUN> my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson <PUN> s as they did when they first came <PUN> she sees them now very often standing in clarke <PUN> s library <PUN>    PP Score = 2.977

well <PUN> jane <PUN> make haste and tell us <PUN> make haste <PUN> my love <PUN>    PP Score = 4.062
<PUN> my dear friend <PUN> <PUN> if you are not so compassionate as to dine to <PUN> day with louisa and me <PUN> we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives <PUN> for a whole day <PUN> s tête <PUN> à <PUN> tête between two women can never end without a quarrel <PUN>    PP Score = 2.898

bennet <PUN> <PUN> that is very unlucky <PUN>    PP Score = 7.519
<PUN> <PUN> can i have the carriage <PUN>    PP Score = 8.338
<PUN> said jane <PUN>    PP Score = 16.141
<PUN> no <PUN> my dear <PUN> you had better go on horseback <PUN> because it seems likely to rain <PUN> and then you must stay all night <PUN>    PP Score = 3.604
<PUN> <PUN> that would be a good scheme <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home <PUN>    PP Score = 3.948
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
but the gentlemen will have mr <PUN>    PP Score = 7.103
bingley <PUN> s chaise to go to meryton <PUN> and the hursts have no horses to theirs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.866
<PUN> <PUN> i had much rather go in the coach <PUN>    PP Score = 3.872
<PUN> <PUN> but <PUN> my dear <PUN> your father cannot spare the horses <PUN> i am sure <PUN>    PP Score = 3.435
they are wanted in the farm <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.071
bennet <PUN> are not they <PUN>    PP Score = 9.591
<PUN> <PUN> they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them <PUN>    PP Score = 2.994
<PUN> <PUN> but if you have got them to <PUN> day <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> my mother <PUN> s purpose will be answered <PUN>    PP Score = 3.898
<PUN> she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged <PUN>    PP Score = 3.707
her hopes were answered <PUN> jane had not been gone long before it rained hard <PUN>    PP Score = 4.779
her sisters were uneasy for her <PUN> but her mother was delighted <PUN>    PP Score = 6.740
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission <PUN> jane certainly could not come back <PUN>    PP Score = 2.796
<PUN> this was a lucky idea of mine <PUN> indeed <PUN>    PP Score = 3.636
<PUN> said mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 18.438
bennet <PUN> more than once <PUN> as if the credit of making it rain were all her own <PUN>    PP Score = 3.415
till the next morning <PUN> however <PUN> she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance <PUN>    PP Score = 5.426
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> my dearest lizzy <PUN> <PUN> i find myself very unwell this morning <PUN> which <PUN> i suppose <PUN> is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday <PUN>    PP Score = 3.375
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better <PUN>    PP Score = 3.203
jones <PUN> <PUN> therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me <PUN> <PUN> and excepting a sore <PUN> throat and head <PUN> ache there is not much the matter with me <PUN>    PP Score = 4.385

<PUN> <PUN> well <PUN> my dear <PUN> <PUN> said mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.002
bennet <PUN> when elizabeth had read the note aloud <PUN> <PUN> if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness <PUN> if she should die <PUN> it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.470
bingley <PUN> and under your orders <PUN>    PP Score = 7.176
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
i am not at all afraid of her dying <PUN>    PP Score = 5.665
people do not die of little trifling colds <PUN>    PP Score = 6.488
as long as she stays there <PUN> it is all very well <PUN>    PP Score = 7.038
i would go and see her <PUN> if i could have the carriage <PUN>    PP Score = 6.001
she declared her resolution <PUN>    PP Score = 14.976
<PUN> <PUN> i shall be very fit to see jane <PUN> <PUN> which is all i want <PUN>    PP Score = 4.509
<PUN> <PUN> is this a hint to me <PUN> lizzy <PUN> <PUN> said her father <PUN> <PUN> to send for the horses <PUN>    PP Score = 4.642
<PUN> <PUN> no <PUN> indeed <PUN>    PP Score = 7.090
i do not wish to avoid the walk <PUN>    PP Score = 7.563
the distance is nothing <PUN> when one has a motive <PUN> only three miles <PUN>    PP Score = 3.055
i shall be back by dinner <PUN>    PP Score = 7.914
<PUN> <PUN> i admire the activity of your benevolence <PUN> <PUN> observed mary <PUN> <PUN> but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason <PUN> and <PUN> in my opinion <PUN> exertion should always be in proportion to what is required <PUN>    PP Score = 2.839
<PUN> <PUN> we will go as far as meryton with you <PUN> <PUN> said catherine and lydia <PUN>    PP Score = 4.326
<PUN> if we make haste <PUN> <PUN> said lydia <PUN> as they walked along <PUN> <PUN> perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes <PUN>    PP Score = 3.384
<PUN> in meryton they parted <PUN> the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers <PUN> wives <PUN> and elizabeth continued her walk alone <PUN> crossing field after field at a quick pace <PUN> jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity <PUN> and finding herself at last within view of the house <PUN> with weary ancles <PUN> dirty stockings <PUN> and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise <PUN>    PP Score = 3.190
she was shewn into the breakfast <PUN> parlour <PUN> where all but jane were assembled <PUN> and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise <PUN>    PP Score = 2.753
<PUN> <PUN> that she should have walked three miles so early in the day <PUN> in such dirty weather <PUN> and by herself <PUN> was almost incredible to mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.250
she was received <PUN> however <PUN> very politely by them <PUN> and in their brother <PUN> s manners there was something better than politeness <PUN> there was good humour and kindness <PUN>    PP Score = 4.034
<PUN> <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.076
darcy said very little <PUN> and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 6.516
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast <PUN>    PP Score = 4.673
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered <PUN>    PP Score = 4.170
miss bennet had slept ill <PUN> and though up <PUN> was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room <PUN>    PP Score = 4.069
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately <PUN> and jane <PUN> who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience <PUN> from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit <PUN> was delighted at her entrance <PUN>    PP Score = 2.606
she was not equal <PUN> however <PUN> to much conversation <PUN> and when miss bingley left them together <PUN> could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with <PUN>    PP Score = 3.102
elizabeth silently attended her <PUN>    PP Score = 11.084
when breakfast was over <PUN> they were joined by the sisters <PUN> and elizabeth began to like them herself <PUN> when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane <PUN>    PP Score = 3.358
the apothecary came <PUN> and having examined his patient <PUN> said <PUN> as might be supposed <PUN> that she had caught a violent cold <PUN> and that they must endeavour to get the better of it <PUN> advised her to return to bed <PUN> and promised her some draughts <PUN>    PP Score = 3.467
the advice was followed readily <PUN> for the feverish symptoms increased <PUN> and her head ached acutely <PUN>    PP Score = 4.817
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment <PUN> nor were the other ladies often absent <PUN> the gentlemen being out <PUN> they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere <PUN>    PP Score = 2.851
when the clock struck three <PUN> elizabeth felt that she must go <PUN> and very unwillingly said so <PUN>    PP Score = 3.842
elizabeth most thankfully consented <PUN> and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay <PUN> and bring back a supply of clothes <PUN>    PP Score = 3.094
chapter viii <PUN>    PP Score = 50.982
to the civil enquiries which then poured in <PUN> and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.440
bingley <PUN> s <PUN> she could not make a very favourable answer <PUN>    PP Score = 7.051
jane was by no means better <PUN>    PP Score = 9.114
the sisters <PUN> on hearing this <PUN> repeated three or four times how much they were grieved <PUN> how shocking it was to have a bad cold <PUN> and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves <PUN> and then thought no more of the matter <PUN> and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them <PUN> restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike <PUN>    PP Score = 2.572
their brother <PUN> indeed <PUN> was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency <PUN>    PP Score = 5.329
his anxiety for jane was evident <PUN> and his attentions to herself most pleasing <PUN> and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others <PUN>    PP Score = 3.090
miss bingley was engrossed by mr <PUN>    PP Score = 6.731
darcy <PUN> her sister scarcely less so <PUN> and as for mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.688
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed <PUN> a mixture of pride and impertinence <PUN> she had no conversation <PUN> no style <PUN> no taste <PUN> no beauty <PUN>    PP Score = 3.192
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
hurst thought the same <PUN> and added <PUN> <PUN> she has nothing <PUN> in short <PUN> to recommend her <PUN> but being an excellent walker <PUN>    PP Score = 4.186
i shall never forget her appearance this morning <PUN>    PP Score = 4.638
she really looked almost wild <PUN>    PP Score = 7.543
<PUN> <PUN> she did indeed <PUN> louisa <PUN>    PP Score = 6.284
i could hardly keep my countenance <PUN>    PP Score = 7.200
very nonsensical to come at all <PUN>    PP Score = 5.810
why must <PUN> she <PUN> be scampering about the country <PUN> because her sister had a cold <PUN>    PP Score = 4.387
her hair so untidy <PUN> so blowsy <PUN>    PP Score = 13.334
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> and her petticoat <PUN> i hope you saw her petticoat <PUN> six inches deep in mud <PUN> i am absolutely certain <PUN> and the gown which had been let down to hide it <PUN> not doing its office <PUN>    PP Score = 3.627
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well <PUN> when she came into the room this morning <PUN>    PP Score = 3.724
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice <PUN>    PP Score = 4.481
darcy <PUN> i am sure <PUN> <PUN> said miss bingley <PUN> <PUN> and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see <PUN> your sister <PUN> make such an exhibition <PUN>    PP Score = 4.350
<PUN> <PUN> certainly not <PUN>    PP Score = 8.693
what could she mean by it <PUN>    PP Score = 6.462
it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence <PUN> a most country town indifference to decorum <PUN>    PP Score = 2.771
<PUN> <PUN> it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing <PUN> <PUN> said bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 4.244
<PUN> i am afraid <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.225
darcy <PUN> <PUN> observed miss bingley <PUN> in a half whisper <PUN> <PUN> that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes <PUN>    PP Score = 3.831
<PUN> <PUN> not at all <PUN> <PUN> he replied <PUN> <PUN> they were brightened by the exercise <PUN>    PP Score = 4.897
<PUN> i have an excessive regard for jane bennet <PUN> she is really a very sweet girl <PUN> and i wish with all my heart she were well settled <PUN>    PP Score = 3.412
<PUN> <PUN> i think i have heard you say <PUN> that their uncle is an attorney in meryton <PUN>    PP Score = 3.396
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> and they have another <PUN> who lives somewhere near cheapside <PUN>    PP Score = 3.414
<PUN> <PUN> that is capital <PUN> <PUN> added her sister <PUN> and they both laughed heartily <PUN>    PP Score = 4.662
<PUN> if they had uncles enough to fill <PUN> all <PUN> cheapside <PUN> <PUN> cried bingley <PUN> <PUN> it would not make them one jot less agreeable <PUN>    PP Score = 4.671
<PUN> <PUN> but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world <PUN> <PUN> replied darcy <PUN>    PP Score = 2.953
to this speech bingley made no answer <PUN> but his sisters gave it their hearty assent <PUN> and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend <PUN> s vulgar relations <PUN>    PP Score = 2.719
with a renewal of tenderness <PUN> however <PUN> they repaired to her room on leaving the dining <PUN> parlour <PUN> and sat with her till summoned to coffee <PUN>    PP Score = 2.916
she was still very poorly <PUN> and elizabeth would not quit her at all <PUN> till late in the evening <PUN> when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep <PUN> and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself <PUN>    PP Score = 3.328
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
hurst looked at her with astonishment <PUN>    PP Score = 9.276
<PUN> do you prefer reading to cards <PUN>    PP Score = 5.960
<PUN> said he <PUN> <PUN> that is rather singular <PUN>    PP Score = 6.002
<PUN> <PUN> miss eliza bennet <PUN> <PUN> said miss bingley <PUN> <PUN> despises cards <PUN>    PP Score = 6.418
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else <PUN>    PP Score = 4.095
<PUN> <PUN> i deserve neither such praise nor such censure <PUN> <PUN> cried elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> i am <PUN> not <PUN> a great reader <PUN> and i have pleasure in many things <PUN>    PP Score = 3.734
<PUN> and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit <PUN> but i am an idle fellow <PUN> and though i have not many <PUN> i have more than i ever look into <PUN>    PP Score = 3.646
<PUN> elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room <PUN>    PP Score = 3.192
<PUN> i am astonished <PUN> <PUN> said miss bingley <PUN> <PUN> that my father should have left so small a collection of books <PUN>    PP Score = 4.219
<PUN> <PUN> what a delightful library you have at pemberley <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.247
darcy <PUN>    PP Score = 26.572
<PUN> <PUN> it ought to be good <PUN> <PUN> he replied <PUN> <PUN> it has been the work of many generations <PUN>    PP Score = 4.309
<PUN> <PUN> and then you have added so much to it yourself <PUN> you are always buying books <PUN>    PP Score = 4.467
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place <PUN>    PP Score = 2.889
<PUN> <PUN> but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood <PUN> and take pemberley for a kind of model <PUN>    PP Score = 2.980
<PUN> <PUN> with all my heart <PUN> i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it <PUN>    PP Score = 4.195
<PUN> <PUN> i am talking of possibilities <PUN> charles <PUN>    PP Score = 6.397
<PUN> <PUN> upon my word <PUN> caroline <PUN> i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation <PUN>    PP Score = 3.185
<PUN> elizabeth was so much caught by what passed <PUN> as to leave her very little attention for her book <PUN> and soon laying it wholly aside <PUN> she drew near the card <PUN> table <PUN> and stationed herself between mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.672
<PUN> is miss darcy much grown since the spring <PUN>    PP Score = 4.296
<PUN> <PUN> i think she will <PUN>    PP Score = 6.517

and so extremely accomplished for her age <PUN>    PP Score = 4.721
her performance on the piano <PUN> forte is exquisite <PUN>    PP Score = 6.374
<PUN> <PUN> all young ladies accomplished <PUN>    PP Score = 6.464
my dear charles <PUN> what do you mean <PUN>    PP Score = 4.526
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> all of them <PUN> i think <PUN>    PP Score = 5.760
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this <PUN> and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time <PUN> without being informed that she was very accomplished <PUN>    PP Score = 3.768
<PUN> <PUN> your list of the common extent of accomplishments <PUN> <PUN> said darcy <PUN> <PUN> has too much truth <PUN>    PP Score = 3.582
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse <PUN> or covering a skreen <PUN>    PP Score = 3.912
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen <PUN> in the whole range of my acquaintance <PUN> that are really accomplished <PUN>    PP Score = 3.176
<PUN> <PUN> nor i <PUN> i am sure <PUN> <PUN> said miss bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 5.215
<PUN> then <PUN> <PUN> observed elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman <PUN>    PP Score = 4.580
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music <PUN> singing <PUN> drawing <PUN> dancing <PUN> and the modern languages <PUN> to deserve the word <PUN> and besides all this <PUN> she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking <PUN> the tone of her voice <PUN> her address and expressions <PUN> or the word will be but half deserved <PUN>    PP Score = 2.625
<PUN> <PUN> all this she must possess <PUN> <PUN> added darcy <PUN> <PUN> and to all this she must yet add something more substantial <PUN> in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading <PUN>    PP Score = 3.600
<PUN> <PUN> i am no longer surprised at your knowing <PUN> only <PUN> six accomplished women <PUN>    PP Score = 3.475
i rather wonder now at your knowing <PUN> any <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 3.798
<PUN> i <PUN> never saw such capacity <PUN> and taste <PUN> and application <PUN> and elegance <PUN> as you describe <PUN> united <PUN>    PP Score = 3.519
<PUN> mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 23.213
hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt <PUN> and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description <PUN> when mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.126
as all conversation was thereby at an end <PUN> elizabeth soon afterwards left the room <PUN>    PP Score = 2.855
<PUN> eliza bennet <PUN> <PUN> said miss bingley <PUN> when the door was closed on her <PUN> <PUN> is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex <PUN> by undervaluing their own <PUN> and with many men <PUN> i dare say <PUN> it succeeds <PUN>    PP Score = 4.703
but <PUN> in my opinion <PUN> it is a paltry device <PUN> a very mean art <PUN>    PP Score = 5.033
<PUN> <PUN> undoubtedly <PUN> <PUN> replied darcy <PUN> to whom this remark was chiefly addressed <PUN> <PUN> there is meanness in <PUN> all <PUN> the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation <PUN>    PP Score = 3.548
<PUN> miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject <PUN>    PP Score = 3.655
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse <PUN> and that she could not leave her <PUN>    PP Score = 4.453
bingley urged mr <PUN>    PP Score = 21.610
jones <PUN> s being sent for immediately <PUN> while his sisters <PUN> convinced that no country advice could be of any service <PUN> recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians <PUN>    PP Score = 2.978
this <PUN> she would not hear of <PUN> but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother <PUN> s proposal <PUN> and it was settled that mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.932
jones should be sent for early in the morning <PUN> if miss bennet were not decidedly better <PUN>    PP Score = 3.264
bingley was quite uncomfortable <PUN> his sisters declared that they were miserable <PUN>    PP Score = 4.145
they solaced their wretchedness <PUN> however <PUN> by duets after supper <PUN> while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister <PUN>    PP Score = 2.389
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister <PUN> s room <PUN> and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.340
bingley by a housemaid <PUN> and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters <PUN>    PP Score = 2.740
in spite of this amendment <PUN> however <PUN> she requested to have a note sent to longbourn <PUN> desiring her mother to visit jane <PUN> and form her own judgment of her situation <PUN>    PP Score = 2.935
the note was immediately dispatched <PUN> and its contents as quickly complied with <PUN>    PP Score = 3.237
bennet <PUN> accompanied by her two youngest girls <PUN> reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast <PUN>    PP Score = 3.147
had she found jane in any apparent danger <PUN> mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.598
bennet would have been very miserable <PUN> but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming <PUN> she had no wish of her recovering immediately <PUN> as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield <PUN>    PP Score = 2.720
she would not listen therefore to her daughter <PUN> s proposal of being carried home <PUN> neither did the apothecary <PUN> who arrived about the same time <PUN> think it at all advisable <PUN>    PP Score = 2.692
after sitting a little while with jane <PUN> on miss bingley <PUN> s appearance and invitation <PUN> the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour <PUN>    PP Score = 2.929
bingley met them with hopes that mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.908
bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected <PUN>    PP Score = 3.711
<PUN> indeed i have <PUN> sir <PUN> <PUN> was her answer <PUN>    PP Score = 5.635
<PUN> she is a great deal too ill to be moved <PUN>    PP Score = 5.020
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
jones says we must not think of moving her <PUN>    PP Score = 5.142
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness <PUN>    PP Score = 4.360
<PUN> <PUN> removed <PUN>    PP Score = 20.188
<PUN> cried bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 18.303
<PUN> it must not be thought of <PUN>    PP Score = 7.603
my sister <PUN> i am sure <PUN> will not hear of her removal <PUN>    PP Score = 6.762
<PUN> <PUN> you may depend upon it <PUN> madam <PUN> <PUN> said miss bingley <PUN> with cold civility <PUN> <PUN> that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us <PUN>    PP Score = 3.041
<PUN> mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 23.213
bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments <PUN>    PP Score = 6.428
<PUN> i am sure <PUN> <PUN> she added <PUN> <PUN> if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her <PUN> for she is very ill indeed <PUN> and suffers a vast deal <PUN> though with the greatest patience in the world <PUN> which is always the way with her <PUN> for she has <PUN> without exception <PUN> the sweetest temper i ever met with <PUN>    PP Score = 3.428
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to <PUN> her <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 3.083
you have a sweet room here <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.750
<PUN> <PUN> whatever i do is done in a hurry <PUN> <PUN> replied he <PUN> <PUN> and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield <PUN> i should probably be off in five minutes <PUN>    PP Score = 3.465
at present <PUN> however <PUN> i consider myself as quite fixed here <PUN>    PP Score = 5.719
<PUN> <PUN> that is exactly what i should have supposed of you <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth <PUN>    PP Score = 3.906
<PUN> you begin to comprehend me <PUN> do you <PUN>    PP Score = 4.092
<PUN> cried he <PUN> turning towards her <PUN>    PP Score = 5.083
<PUN> <PUN> i wish i might take this for a compliment <PUN> but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful <PUN>    PP Score = 3.571
<PUN> <PUN> that is as it happens <PUN>    PP Score = 5.666
it must be an amusing study <PUN>    PP Score = 8.240
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> but intricate characters are the <PUN> most <PUN> amusing <PUN>    PP Score = 2.768
they have at least that advantage <PUN>    PP Score = 7.498
<PUN> <PUN> the country <PUN> <PUN> said darcy <PUN> <PUN> can in general supply but few subjects for such a study <PUN>    PP Score = 4.080
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society <PUN>    PP Score = 4.576
<PUN> <PUN> but people themselves alter so much <PUN> that there is something new to be observed in them for ever <PUN>    PP Score = 3.283
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> indeed <PUN> <PUN> cried mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 5.402
bennet <PUN> offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood <PUN>    PP Score = 3.432
<PUN> i assure you there is quite as much of <PUN> that <PUN> going on in the country as in town <PUN>    PP Score = 3.580
<PUN> every body was surprised <PUN> and darcy <PUN> after looking at her for a moment <PUN> turned silently away <PUN>    PP Score = 4.225
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
bennet <PUN> who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him <PUN> continued her triumph <PUN>    PP Score = 3.439
<PUN> i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part <PUN> except the shops and public places <PUN>    PP Score = 2.996
the country is a vast deal pleasanter <PUN> is not it <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.553
bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 56.540
<PUN> <PUN> when i am in the country <PUN> <PUN> he replied <PUN> <PUN> i never wish to leave it <PUN> and when i am in town it is pretty much the same <PUN>    PP Score = 4.497
they have each their advantages <PUN> and i can be equally happy in either <PUN>    PP Score = 4.607
<PUN> <PUN> aye <PUN> <PUN> that is because you have the right disposition <PUN>    PP Score = 4.520
but that gentleman <PUN> <PUN> looking at darcy <PUN> <PUN> seemed to think the country was nothing at all <PUN>    PP Score = 3.904
<PUN> <PUN> indeed <PUN> mama <PUN> you are mistaken <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth <PUN> blushing for her mother <PUN>    PP Score = 4.735
<PUN> you quite mistook mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.308
darcy <PUN>    PP Score = 26.572
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town <PUN> which you must acknowledge to be true <PUN>    PP Score = 2.912
<PUN> <PUN> certainly <PUN> my dear <PUN> nobody said there were <PUN> but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood <PUN> i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger <PUN>    PP Score = 3.389
<PUN> nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance <PUN>    PP Score = 4.455
his sister was less delicate <PUN> and directed her eye towards mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.663
darcy with a very expressive smile <PUN>    PP Score = 9.004
<PUN> yes <PUN> she called yesterday with her father <PUN>    PP Score = 4.566
what an agreeable man sir william is <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.024
bingley <PUN> <PUN> is not he <PUN>    PP Score = 11.851
so much the man of fashion <PUN>    PP Score = 8.440
so genteel and so easy <PUN>    PP Score = 8.997
<PUN> <PUN> he has always something to say to every body <PUN>    PP Score = 4.480
<PUN> <PUN> did charlotte dine with you <PUN>    PP Score = 4.925
<PUN> <PUN> no <PUN> she would go home <PUN>    PP Score = 6.168
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies <PUN>    PP Score = 8.663
for my part <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.937
bingley <PUN> <PUN> i <PUN> always keep servants that can do their own work <PUN> <PUN> my <PUN> daughters are brought up differently <PUN>    PP Score = 3.763
but every body is to judge for themselves <PUN> and the lucases are very good sort of girls <PUN> i assure you <PUN>    PP Score = 3.518
it is a pity they are not handsome <PUN>    PP Score = 6.509
<PUN> <PUN> she seems a very pleasant young woman <PUN> <PUN> said bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 4.508
<PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 22.415
lady lucas herself has often said so <PUN> and envied me jane <PUN> s beauty <PUN>    PP Score = 3.648
i do not like to boast of my own child <PUN> but to be sure <PUN> jane <PUN> <PUN> one does not often see any body better looking <PUN>    PP Score = 4.004
it is what every body says <PUN>    PP Score = 7.254
i do not trust my own partiality <PUN>    PP Score = 7.088
when she was only fifteen <PUN> there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner <PUN> s in town <PUN> so much in love with her <PUN> that my sister <PUN> in <PUN> law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away <PUN>    PP Score = 3.753
but however he did not <PUN>    PP Score = 7.360
perhaps he thought her too young <PUN>    PP Score = 6.696
however <PUN> he wrote some verses on her <PUN> and very pretty they were <PUN>    PP Score = 6.728
<PUN> there has been many a one <PUN> i fancy <PUN> overcome in the same way <PUN>    PP Score = 3.728
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love <PUN>    PP Score = 3.619
<PUN> <PUN> i have been used to consider poetry as the <PUN> food <PUN> of love <PUN> <PUN> said darcy <PUN>    PP Score = 4.351
but if it be only a slight <PUN> thin sort of inclination <PUN> i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away <PUN>    PP Score = 3.866
she longed to speak <PUN> but could think of nothing to say <PUN> and after a short silence mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.652
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.674
bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer <PUN> and forced his younger sister to be civil also <PUN> and say what the occasion required <PUN>    PP Score = 2.859
bennet was satisfied <PUN> and soon afterwards ordered her carriage <PUN>    PP Score = 4.563
upon this signal <PUN> the youngest of her daughters put herself forward <PUN>    PP Score = 3.652
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit <PUN> and the result of it was <PUN> that the youngest should tax mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.303
bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield <PUN>    PP Score = 3.202
lydia was a stout <PUN> well <PUN> grown girl of fifteen <PUN> with a fine complexion and good <PUN> humoured countenance <PUN> a favourite with her mother <PUN> whose affection had brought her into public at an early age <PUN>    PP Score = 2.841
she had high animal spirits <PUN> and a sort of natural self <PUN> consequence <PUN> which the attentions of the officers <PUN> to whom her uncle <PUN> s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her <PUN> had increased into assurance <PUN>    PP Score = 3.535
she was very equal therefore to address mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.656
bingley on the subject of the ball <PUN> and abruptly reminded him of his promise <PUN> adding <PUN> that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.463
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother <PUN> s ear <PUN>    PP Score = 3.978
<PUN> i am perfectly ready <PUN> i assure you <PUN> to keep my engagement <PUN> and when your sister is recovered <PUN> you shall if you please name the very day of the ball <PUN>    PP Score = 3.097
<PUN> lydia declared herself satisfied <PUN>    PP Score = 7.816
<PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 22.415
and when you have given <PUN> your <PUN> ball <PUN> <PUN> she added <PUN> <PUN> i shall insist on their giving one also <PUN>    PP Score = 4.437
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not <PUN>    PP Score = 3.712
<PUN> mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 23.213
bennet and her daughters then departed <PUN> and elizabeth returned instantly to jane <PUN> leaving her own and her relations <PUN> behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.983
darcy <PUN> the latter of whom <PUN> however <PUN> could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of <PUN> her <PUN> <PUN> in spite of all miss bingley <PUN> s witticisms on <PUN> fine eyes <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 3.946
chapter x <PUN>    PP Score = 50.982
the day passed much as the day before had done <PUN>    PP Score = 5.465
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid <PUN> who continued <PUN> though slowly <PUN> to mend <PUN> and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing <PUN> room <PUN>    PP Score = 2.826
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
darcy was writing <PUN> and miss bingley <PUN> seated near him <PUN> was watching the progress of his letter <PUN> and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister <PUN>    PP Score = 3.260
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
hurst and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 20.361
bingley were at piquet <PUN> and mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 8.616
hurst was observing their game <PUN>    PP Score = 7.107
elizabeth took up some needlework <PUN> and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion <PUN>    PP Score = 3.462
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand <PUN> writing <PUN> or on the evenness of his lines <PUN> or on the length of his letter <PUN> with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received <PUN> formed a curious dialogue <PUN> and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each <PUN>    PP Score = 2.668
<PUN> how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter <PUN>    PP Score = 3.525
<PUN> he made no answer <PUN>    PP Score = 7.177
<PUN> you write uncommonly fast <PUN>    PP Score = 7.990
i write rather slowly <PUN>    PP Score = 13.417
letters of business too <PUN>    PP Score = 12.041
<PUN> <PUN> it is fortunate <PUN> then <PUN> that they fall to my lot instead of to yours <PUN>    PP Score = 3.530
<PUN> <PUN> pray tell your sister that i long to see her <PUN>    PP Score = 3.389
<PUN> <PUN> i have already told her so once <PUN> by your desire <PUN>    PP Score = 3.698
let me mend it for you <PUN>    PP Score = 5.923
i mend pens remarkably well <PUN>    PP Score = 15.046
<PUN> <PUN> how can you contrive to write so even <PUN>    PP Score = 3.582
<PUN> he was silent <PUN>    PP Score = 23.250
<PUN> tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp <PUN> and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table <PUN> and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley <PUN> s <PUN>    PP Score = 3.481
<PUN> <PUN> at present i have not room to do them justice <PUN>    PP Score = 4.863
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
it is of no consequence <PUN>    PP Score = 9.112
darcy <PUN>    PP Score = 26.572
<PUN> <PUN> they are generally long <PUN> but whether always charming <PUN> it is not for me to determine <PUN>    PP Score = 3.639
<PUN> <PUN> that will not do for a compliment to darcy <PUN> caroline <PUN> <PUN> cried her brother <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> because he does <PUN> not <PUN> write with ease <PUN>    PP Score = 4.467
he studies too much for words of four syllables <PUN>    PP Score = 6.619
<PUN> <PUN> do not you <PUN> darcy <PUN>    PP Score = 5.671
<PUN> <PUN> my style of writing is very different from yours <PUN>    PP Score = 3.405
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
<PUN> cried miss bingley <PUN> <PUN> charles writes in the most careless way imaginable <PUN>    PP Score = 4.745
he leaves out half his words <PUN> and blots the rest <PUN>    PP Score = 4.813
<PUN> <PUN> my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them <PUN> <PUN> by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents <PUN>    PP Score = 3.164
<PUN> <PUN> your humility <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.534
bingley <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> must disarm reproof <PUN>    PP Score = 7.513
it is often only carelessness of opinion <PUN> and sometimes an indirect boast <PUN>    PP Score = 3.463
<PUN> <PUN> and which of the two do you call <PUN> my <PUN> little recent piece of modesty <PUN>    PP Score = 3.692
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor <PUN> and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance <PUN>    PP Score = 3.066
when you told mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 13.263
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes <PUN> you meant it to be a sort of panegyric <PUN> of compliment to yourself <PUN> <PUN> and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone <PUN> and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else <PUN>    PP Score = 2.660
and yet <PUN> upon my honour <PUN> i believed what i said of myself to be true <PUN> and i believe it at this moment <PUN>    PP Score = 3.773
<PUN> <PUN> i dare say you believed it <PUN> but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity <PUN>    PP Score = 4.593
<PUN> <PUN> you have only proved by this <PUN> <PUN> cried elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> that mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.405
bingley did not do justice to his own disposition <PUN>    PP Score = 5.742
<PUN> <PUN> i am exceedingly gratified <PUN> <PUN> said bingley <PUN> <PUN> by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper <PUN>    PP Score = 3.307
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend <PUN> for he would certainly think the better of me <PUN> if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial <PUN> and ride off as fast as i could <PUN>    PP Score = 2.871
<PUN> <PUN> would mr <PUN>    PP Score = 12.263
darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.949
<PUN> <PUN> upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter <PUN> darcy must speak for himself <PUN>    PP Score = 2.683
<PUN> <PUN> you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine <PUN> but which i have never acknowledged <PUN>    PP Score = 2.977
<PUN> <PUN> to yield readily <PUN> <PUN> easily <PUN> <PUN> to the <PUN> persuasion <PUN> of a friend is no merit with you <PUN>    PP Score = 3.446
<PUN> <PUN> to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either <PUN>    PP Score = 3.023
<PUN> <PUN> you appear to me <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 6.717
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.804
bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 56.540
we may as well wait <PUN> perhaps <PUN> till the circumstance occurs <PUN> before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon <PUN>    PP Score = 3.607
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend <PUN> where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment <PUN> should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire <PUN> without waiting to be argued into it <PUN>    PP Score = 2.350
<PUN> <PUN> will it not be advisable <PUN> before we proceed on this subject <PUN> to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request <PUN> as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties <PUN>    PP Score = 2.988
<PUN> <PUN> by all means <PUN> <PUN> cried bingley <PUN> <PUN> let us hear all the particulars <PUN> not forgetting their comparative height and size <PUN> for that will have more weight in the argument <PUN> miss bennet <PUN> than you may be aware of <PUN>    PP Score = 2.821
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow <PUN> in comparison with myself <PUN> i should not pay him half so much deference <PUN>    PP Score = 3.121
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy <PUN> on particular occasions <PUN> and in particular places <PUN> at his own house especially <PUN> and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do <PUN>    PP Score = 3.291
<PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 15.595
darcy smiled <PUN> but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended <PUN> and therefore checked her laugh <PUN>    PP Score = 4.262
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received <PUN> in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense <PUN>    PP Score = 3.192
<PUN> i see your design <PUN> bingley <PUN> <PUN> said his friend <PUN>    PP Score = 5.845

<PUN> <PUN> what you ask <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth <PUN> <PUN> is no sacrifice on my side <PUN> and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.452
darcy had much better finish his letter <PUN>    PP Score = 5.059
darcy took her advice <PUN> and did finish his letter <PUN>    PP Score = 3.837
when that business was over <PUN> he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music <PUN>    PP Score = 3.398
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano <PUN> forte <PUN> and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way <PUN> which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived <PUN> she seated herself <PUN>    PP Score = 2.591
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
darcy <PUN> s eyes were fixed on her <PUN>    PP Score = 4.200
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man <PUN> and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her <PUN> was still more strange <PUN>    PP Score = 3.488
the supposition did not pain her <PUN>    PP Score = 6.679
she liked him too little to care for his approbation <PUN>    PP Score = 4.280
after playing some italian songs <PUN> miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air <PUN> and soon afterwards mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.847
darcy <PUN> drawing near elizabeth <PUN> said to her <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> do not you feel a great inclination <PUN> miss bennet <PUN> to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel <PUN>    PP Score = 4.254
<PUN> she smiled <PUN> but made no answer <PUN>    PP Score = 4.673
<PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 22.415
<PUN> said she <PUN> <PUN> i heard you before <PUN> but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply <PUN>    PP Score = 4.715
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you <PUN> that i do not want to dance a reel at all <PUN> <PUN> and now despise me if you dare <PUN>    PP Score = 3.631
<PUN> <PUN> indeed i do not dare <PUN>    PP Score = 7.949
<PUN> elizabeth <PUN> having rather expected to affront him <PUN> was amazed at his gallantry <PUN> but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody <PUN> and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her <PUN>    PP Score = 2.881
he really believed <PUN> that were it not for the inferiority of her connections <PUN> he should be in some danger <PUN>    PP Score = 3.048
miss bingley saw <PUN> or suspected enough to be jealous <PUN> and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane <PUN> received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth <PUN>    PP Score = 2.414
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest <PUN> by talking of their supposed marriage <PUN> and planning his happiness in such an alliance <PUN>    PP Score = 2.702
<PUN> <PUN> and <PUN> if i may mention so delicate a subject <PUN> endeavour to check that little something <PUN> bordering on conceit and impertinence <PUN> which your lady possesses <PUN>    PP Score = 3.040
<PUN> <PUN> have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity <PUN>    PP Score = 3.297
<PUN> <PUN> do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley <PUN>    PP Score = 2.921

as for your elizabeth <PUN> s picture <PUN> you must not attempt to have it taken <PUN> for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes <PUN>    PP Score = 3.629
<PUN> at that moment they were met from another walk <PUN> by mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.841
<PUN> i did not know that you intended to walk <PUN> <PUN> said miss bingley <PUN> in some confusion <PUN> lest they had been overheard <PUN>    PP Score = 3.985
<PUN> you used us abominably ill <PUN> <PUN> answered mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 4.014
<PUN> then taking the disengaged arm of mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.895
the path just admitted three <PUN>    PP Score = 8.105
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> this walk is not wide enough for our party <PUN>    PP Score = 3.617
we had better go into the avenue <PUN>    PP Score = 9.960
<PUN> but elizabeth <PUN> who had not the least inclination to remain with them <PUN> laughingly answered <PUN> <PUN> no <PUN> no <PUN> stay where you are <PUN>    PP Score = 3.862
<PUN> <PUN> you are charmingly group <PUN> d <PUN> and appear to uncommon advantage <PUN>    PP Score = 2.938
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth <PUN>    PP Score = 4.854
good bye <PUN>    PP Score = 68.663
<PUN> she then ran gaily off <PUN> rejoicing as she rambled about <PUN> in the hope of being at home again in a day or two <PUN>    PP Score = 3.089
when the ladies removed after dinner <PUN> elizabeth ran up to her sister <PUN> and seeing her well guarded from cold <PUN> attended her into the drawing <PUN> room <PUN> where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure <PUN> and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared <PUN>    PP Score = 2.769
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy <PUN> relate an anecdote with humour <PUN> and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit <PUN>    PP Score = 3.034
but when the gentlemen entered <PUN> jane was no longer the first object <PUN>    PP Score = 5.218
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet <PUN> with a polite congratulation <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 6.554
hurst also made her a slight bow <PUN> and said he was <PUN> very glad <PUN> <PUN> but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley <PUN> s salutation <PUN>    PP Score = 3.876
he was full of joy and attention <PUN>    PP Score = 5.348
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire <PUN> lest she should suffer from the change of room <PUN> and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire <PUN> place <PUN> that she might be farther from the door <PUN>    PP Score = 3.007
he then sat down by her <PUN> and talked scarcely to any one else <PUN>    PP Score = 4.860
when tea was over <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 7.833
hurst reminded his sister <PUN> in <PUN> law of the card <PUN> table <PUN> <PUN> but in vain <PUN>    PP Score = 4.431
she had obtained private intelligence that mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.460
darcy did not wish for cards <PUN> and mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.220
hurst soon found even his open petition rejected <PUN>    PP Score = 6.076
she assured him that no one intended to play <PUN> and the silence of the whole party on the subject <PUN> seemed to justify her <PUN>    PP Score = 4.009
darcy took up a book <PUN> miss bingley did the same <PUN> and mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 3.910
hurst <PUN> principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings <PUN> joined now and then in her brother <PUN> s conversation with miss bennet <PUN>    PP Score = 3.510
darcy <PUN> s progress through <PUN> his <PUN> book <PUN> as in reading her own <PUN> and she was perpetually either making some inquiry <PUN> or looking at his page <PUN>    PP Score = 2.938
she could not win him <PUN> however <PUN> to any conversation <PUN> he merely answered her question <PUN> and read on <PUN>    PP Score = 3.669
i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading <PUN>    PP Score = 5.422
how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book <PUN>    PP Score = 4.891
<PUN> no one made any reply <PUN>    PP Score = 9.279
she then yawned again <PUN> threw aside her book <PUN> and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement <PUN> when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet <PUN> she turned suddenly towards him and said <PUN> <PUN> by the bye <PUN> charles <PUN> are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield <PUN>    PP Score = 2.560
<PUN> <PUN> i would advise you <PUN> before you determine on it <PUN> to consult the wishes of the present party <PUN> i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure <PUN>    PP Score = 2.504
<PUN> <PUN> if you mean darcy <PUN> <PUN> cried her brother <PUN> <PUN> he may go to bed <PUN> if he chuses <PUN> before it begins <PUN> <PUN> but as for the ball <PUN> it is quite a settled thing <PUN> and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards <PUN>    PP Score = 3.565
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day <PUN>    PP Score = 2.432
<PUN> <PUN> much more rational <PUN> my dear caroline <PUN> i dare say <PUN> but it would not be near so much like a ball <PUN>    PP Score = 3.771
<PUN> miss bingley made no answer <PUN> and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room <PUN>    PP Score = 3.076
her figure was elegant <PUN> and she walked well <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> but darcy <PUN> at whom it was all aimed <PUN> was still inflexibly studious <PUN>    PP Score = 5.674
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more <PUN> and <PUN> turning to elizabeth <PUN> said <PUN> <PUN> miss eliza bennet <PUN> let me persuade you to follow my example <PUN> and take a turn about the room <PUN>    PP Score = 3.519
<PUN> <PUN> i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude <PUN>    PP Score = 4.153
<PUN> elizabeth was surprised <PUN> but agreed to it immediately <PUN>    PP Score = 4.372
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.291
darcy looked up <PUN>    PP Score = 21.785
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be <PUN> and unconsciously closed his book <PUN>    PP Score = 2.656
<PUN> what could he mean <PUN>    PP Score = 8.851
she was dying to know what could be his meaning <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him <PUN>    PP Score = 3.752
<PUN> not at all <PUN> <PUN> was her answer <PUN> <PUN> but depend upon it <PUN> he means to be severe on us <PUN> and our surest way of disappointing him <PUN> will be to ask nothing about it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.268
<PUN> miss bingley <PUN> however <PUN> was incapable of disappointing mr <PUN>    PP Score = 5.857
darcy in any thing <PUN> and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives <PUN>    PP Score = 4.147
<PUN> i have not the smallest objection to explaining them <PUN> <PUN> said he <PUN> as soon as she allowed him to speak <PUN>    PP Score = 4.055
<PUN> you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other <PUN> s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss <PUN> or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> if the first <PUN> i should be completely in your way <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> and if the second <PUN> i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire <PUN>    PP Score = 2.940
<PUN> <PUN> oh <PUN>    PP Score = 5.611
shocking <PUN>    PP Score = 7518.670
<PUN> cried miss bingley <PUN>    PP Score = 8.154
how shall we punish him for such a speech <PUN>    PP Score = 5.326
<PUN> <PUN> nothing so easy <PUN> if you have but the inclination <PUN> <PUN> said elizabeth <PUN>    PP Score = 4.055
<PUN> we can all plague and punish one another <PUN>    PP Score = 4.885
teaze him <PUN> <PUN> laugh at him <PUN>    PP Score = 8.425
<PUN> <PUN> intimate as you are <PUN> you must know how it is to be done <PUN>    PP Score = 4.190
<PUN> <PUN> but upon my honour i do <PUN> not <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 3.998
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me <PUN> that <PUN> <PUN>    PP Score = 3.220
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind <PUN>    PP Score = 4.305
and as to laughter <PUN> we will not expose ourselves <PUN> if you please <PUN> by attempting to laugh without a subject <PUN>    PP Score = 3.054
mr <PUN>    PP Score = 65.963
darcy may hug himself <PUN>    PP Score = 20.050
<PUN> <PUN> mr <PUN>    PP Score = 8.076
darcy is not to be laughed at <PUN>    PP Score = 7.157
<PUN> cried elizabeth <PUN>    PP Score = 8.764
<PUN> that is an uncommon advantage <PUN> and uncommon i hope it will continue <PUN> for it would be a great loss to <PUN> me <PUN> to have many such acquaintance <PUN>    PP Score = 3.406
i dearly love a laugh <PUN>    PP Score = 8.631
<PUN> <PUN> miss bingley <PUN> <PUN> said he <PUN> <PUN> has given me credit for more than can be <PUN>    PP Score = 3.959
the wisest and the best of men <PUN> nay <PUN> the wisest and best of their actions <PUN> may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke <PUN>    PP Score = 2.614
follies and nonsense <PUN> whims and inconsistencies <PUN> do <PUN> divert me <PUN> i own <PUN> and i laugh at them whenever i can <PUN>    PP Score = 4.334
<PUN> <PUN> but these <PUN> i suppose <PUN> are precisely what you are without <PUN>    PP Score = 5.087
<PUN> <PUN> perhaps that is not possible for any one <PUN>    PP Score = 4.281
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule <PUN>    PP Score = 3.116
<PUN> <PUN> such as vanity and pride <PUN>    PP Score = 5.489
<PUN> <PUN> yes <PUN> vanity is a weakness indeed <PUN>    PP Score = 3.467
but pride <PUN> <PUN> where there is a real superiority of mind <PUN> pride will be always under good regulation <PUN>    PP Score = 4.988
<PUN> elizabeth turned away to hide a smile <PUN>    PP Score = 4.320
<PUN> your examination of mr <PUN>    PP Score = 7.755
darcy is over <PUN> i presume <PUN> <PUN> said miss bingley <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> and pray what is the result <PUN>    PP Score = 5.109
<PUN> <PUN> i am perfectly convinced by it that mr <PUN>    PP Score = 4.346
darcy has no defect <PUN>    PP Score = 15.366
he owns it himself without disguise <PUN>    PP Score = 5.930
<PUN> <PUN> no <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> said darcy <PUN> <PUN> i have made no such pretension <PUN>    PP Score = 6.014
i have faults enough <PUN> but they are not <PUN> i hope <PUN> of understanding <PUN>    PP Score = 4.875
my temper i dare not vouch for <PUN>    PP Score = 5.561
<PUN> <PUN> it is i believe too little yielding <PUN> <PUN> certainly too little for the convenience of the world <PUN>    PP Score = 2.975
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought <PUN> nor their offences against myself <PUN>    PP Score = 3.409
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them <PUN>    PP Score = 4.190
my temper would perhaps be called resentful <PUN>    PP Score = 4.901
<PUN> <PUN> my good opinion once lost is lost for ever <PUN>    PP Score = 3.053
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> that <PUN> is a failing indeed <PUN>    PP Score = 7.467
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> cried elizabeth <PUN>    PP Score = 8.369
<PUN> implacable resentment <PUN> is <PUN> a shade in a character <PUN>    PP Score = 5.037
but you have chosen your fault well <PUN>    PP Score = 5.488
<PUN> <PUN> i really cannot <PUN> laugh <PUN> at it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.979
you are safe from me <PUN>    PP Score = 8.207
<PUN> <PUN> and <PUN> your <PUN> defect is a propensity to hate every body <PUN>    PP Score = 4.714
<PUN> <PUN> do let us have a little music <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> <PUN> cried miss bingley <PUN> tired of a conversation in which she had no share <PUN>    PP Score = 4.390
<PUN> <PUN> <PUN> louisa <PUN> you will not mind my waking mr <PUN>    PP Score = 6.349
<PUN> her sister made not the smallest objection <PUN> and the piano <PUN> forte was opened <PUN> and darcy <PUN> after a few moments recollection <PUN> was not sorry for it <PUN>    PP Score = 3.567
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention <PUN>    PP Score = 3.598
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters <PUN> elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother <PUN> to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day <PUN>    PP Score = 3.123
bennet <PUN> who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday <PUN> which would exactly finish jane <PUN> s week <PUN> could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before <PUN>    PP Score = 2.725
her answer <PUN> therefore <PUN> was not propitious <PUN> at least not to elizabeth <PUN> s wishes <PUN> for she was impatient to get home <PUN>    PP Score = 4.527
mrs <PUN>    PP Score = 97.660
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday <PUN> and in her postscript it was added <PUN> that if mr <PUN>    PP Score = 3.214
<PUN> <PUN> against staying longer <PUN> however <PUN> elizabeth was positively resolved <PUN> <PUN> nor did she much expect it would be asked <PUN> and fearful <PUN> on the contrary <PUN> as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long <PUN> she urged jane to borrow mr <PUN>    PP Score = 2.751
bingley <PUN> s carriage immediately <PUN> and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned <PUN> and the request made <PUN>    PP Score = 3.438
the communication excited many professions of concern <PUN> and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane <PUN> and till the morrow <PUN> their going was deferred <PUN>    PP Score = 2.626
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay <PUN> for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other <PUN>    PP Score = 2.643
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon <PUN> and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her <PUN> <PUN> that she was not enough recovered <PUN> but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right <PUN>    PP Score = 3.538
to mr <PUN>    PP Score = 55.068
she attracted him more than he liked <PUN> <PUN> and miss bingley was uncivil to <PUN> her <PUN> <PUN> and more teazing than usual to himself <PUN>    PP Score = 4.456
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should <PUN> now <PUN> escape him <PUN> nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity <PUN> sensible that if such an idea had been suggested <PUN> his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it <PUN>    PP Score = 2.515
steady to his purpose <PUN> he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday <PUN> and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour <PUN> he adhered most conscientiously to his book <PUN> and would not even look at her <PUN>    PP Score = 3.107
on sunday <PUN> after morning service <PUN> the separation <PUN> so agreeable to almost all <PUN> took place <PUN>    PP Score = 2.800
<PUN> <PUN> elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits <PUN>    PP Score = 4.432
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother <PUN>    PP Score = 3.610
bennet wondered at their coming <PUN> and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble <PUN> and was sure jane would have caught cold again <PUN>    PP Score = 2.866
<PUN> <PUN> but their father <PUN> though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure <PUN> was really glad to see them <PUN> he had felt their importance in the family circle <PUN>    PP Score = 3.691
the evening conversation <PUN> when they were all assembled <PUN> had lost much of its animation <PUN> and almost all its sense <PUN> by the absence of jane and elizabeth <PUN>    PP Score = 2.938
they found mary <PUN> as usual <PUN> deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature <PUN> and had some new extracts to admire <PUN> and some new observations of thread <PUN> bare morality to listen to <PUN>    PP Score = 2.725
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort <PUN>    PP Score = 4.265

<PUN> <PUN> who do you mean <PUN> my dear <PUN>    PP Score = 5.487
i know of nobody that is coming i am sure <PUN> unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in <PUN> and i hope <PUN> my <PUN> dinners are good enough for her <PUN>    PP Score = 3.557
